          "description": "Over on the Open Source Initiative (OSI) blog, the organization has announced the Open Policy Alliance (OPA), which is meant to bring together various non-profit organizations to help educate and inform US policy makers about open-source software and its needs:\n\nThe need to create such a program is more urgent today due to the rise of new regulations in the software industry and adjacent open domains around the world. Cyber security, the societal impact of AI, data and privacy are important issues for legislators globally. At the same time, the COVID-19 pandemic drove collaborative development to unprecedented levels and took Open Source software, open research, open content and data from mainstream to main stage. Moving forward, developing these important public policies whilst not harming the ecosystem requires an understanding of how the Open Source ecosystem works. Ensuring stakeholders without historic benefit of representation are included in those discussions becomes paramount to that end.\n\nThe OPA will focus on educating public policy makers on Open Source to inform their development and deliberation of new policy concepts. There are unintended consequences that come from a lack of understanding of how open collaboration works in practice. The OPA will address this as well as the historic absence of contribution from underrepresented groups. The interest areas of the OPA community will complement those of Digitable Public Goods Alliance, a UNICEF multi-stakeholder initiative with a mission to accelerate the attainment of sustainable development goals in low- and middle-income countries that OSI joined earlier this year.",

That brings me to CentOS Stream, of which there\n\tis immense confusion. I acknowledge that this is a change in a\n\tlongstanding tradition where we went above and beyond, and change\n\tlike this can cause some confusion. That confusion manifested as\n\taccusations about us going closed-source and about alleged GPL\n\tviolations. There is CentOS Stream the binary deliverable, and\n\tCentOS Stream the source repository. The CentOS Stream\n\tgitlab source is where we build RHEL releases, in the open for\n\tall to see. To call RHEL “closed source” is categorically untrue\n\tand inaccurate. CentOS Stream moves faster than RHEL, so it might\n\tnot be on HEAD, but the code is there. If you can’t find it, it’s a\n\tbug – please let us know.",

          "description": "Over on the Software Freedom Conservancy blog, Policy Fellow and Hacker-in-Residence Bradley M. Kuhn analyzes the recent changes to Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) source availability in light of the GPL.  It contains some interesting information about two alleged GPL violations that came about because the company's business model is structured in a way that brings it too close to non-compliance with the license, he said:\n\nPerhaps the biggest problem with a murky business model that skirts the line of GPL compliance is that violations can and do happen — since even a minor deviation from the business model clearly violates the GPL agreements. Pre-IBM Red Hat deserves a certain amount of credit, as SFC is aware of only two documented incidents of GPL violations that have occurred since 2006 regarding the RHEL business model. We've decided to share some general details of these violations for the purpose of explaining where this business model can so easily cross the line.\n\n[...] In another violation incident, we learned that Red Hat, in a specific non-USA country, was requiring that any customer who lowered the number of RHEL machines under service contract with Red Hat sign an additional agreement. This additional agreement promised that the customer had deleted every copy of RHEL in their entire organization other than the copies of RHEL that were currently contracted for service with Red Hat. Again, this is a \"further restriction\". The GPL agreements give everyone the unfettered right to make and keep as many copies of the software as they like, and a distributor of GPL'd software may not require a user to attest that they've deleted these legitimate, licensed copies of third-party-licensed software under the GPL. SFC informed Red Hat's legal department of this violation, and we were assured that this additional agreement would no longer be presented to any Red Hat customers in the future.",

Without a built-in or standard library hash\ntable, the latter sounds onerous. However, a mask-step-index table,\na hash table construction suitable for many problems, requires only a few\nlines of code. This approach is useful even when a standard hash table is\navailable, because by exploiting the known problem constraints, it\nbeats typical generic hash table performance by 1–2 orders of magnitude\n(demo).\nThe Two Sum exercise, restated:\nGiven an integer array and target, return the distinct indices of two\nelements that sum to the target.\nIn particular, the solution doesn’t find elements, but their indices.

In theory, this is supposed to allow assessing the risk associated with an extension. In reality however, users typically lack the knowledge to properly interpret this prompt. For example, I’ve often seen users accusing extension developers of spying just because the prompt says they could.\n\n\nOn the other hand, people will often accept these cryptic prompts without thinking twice. They expect the browser vendors to keep them out of harm’s way, trust that isn’t always justified [1] [2] [3].

The board has been fondly named\nthe “KlusterLab”, because of all of the various interfaces present on it.\nAmong those interfaces are an SD port and an eMMC port.\nNow, how shall I verify their functionality?\nBuilding an SDIO/eMMC Controller\nMy first round of testing the SD port used my SPI-based SD card controller,\nSDSPI.  Using that controller, the card\nresponded in much the way I expected, save that the first sector of the card\nwasn’t what FATFS was expecting.\nSince this is simply board bringup, where we are just trying to verify that the\nhardware is working, I signed the component off as working.  I could obviously\nwrite to the device, and I could read from the device.  (Okay, I…",
