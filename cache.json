          "description": "When you start to build web applications with Go, one of the first questions you'll probably ask is \"which\n    router should I use?\". \nIt's not an easy question to answer, either. There are probably more than 100 different routers\n        available, all with different APIs, features, and behaviors. So for this blog post I've evaluated 30 popular\n        ones, and created a shortlist of the best options along with a flowchart that you can use to help guide your choice.\n    \nNote: If you don't want to read the discussion, you can skip to the flowchart.\n    \nBefore we start, a few notes on terminology:\nBy supports method-based routing I mean that the router makes it easy to dispatch a HTTP\n        request to different handlers based on the request method (\"GET\",\n        \"POST\", etc).\nBy suppo…",

As Flutter has grown in popularity over the past few years, over 100 Meetup groups have sprung up organically around the world to celebrate and educate their members about Flutter. The volunteers who run these groups have hosted many awesome events and workshops. \n    \nWe, in the Flutter team, see and appreciate these amazing communities. 💙 The Flutter Meetup Network (FMN) is now being launched to support these groups officially. Network members will have access to various resources (more details available soon!), making it easier to plan and host Flutter-themed events. \nMeetups have many benefits, aside from networking. When stuck on an issue in your current Flutter project, chances are good that you can find a developer in your local Flutter Meetup who has solved a similar problem. Or, maybe they know the perfect package for your needs. \nWe are thrilled to support our amazing and passionate organizers and can’t wait to see what the Flutter Meetup Network does moving forward. \nJoin a Meetup near you! https://www.meetup.com/pro/flutter",

Rust developers, though, are currently limited to the\nLLVM-based rustc compiler.  While rustc works well, there\nare legitimate reasons for developers to wish for an alternative.  As it\nturns out, there are two different ways to compile Rust using GCC under\ndevelopment, though neither is ready at the moment.  Developers of both\napproaches came to the 2021 Linux\nPlumbers Conference to present the status of their work.",

          "description": "Paul McKenney has started a blog series on Rust for the Linux kernel.  He has posted six of a planned 11 articles, though several are labeled as \"under construction\".\n\nThis series focuses mostly on use cases and opportunities, rather than on any non-trivial solutions. Please note that I am not in any way attempting to dictate or limit Rust's level of ambition. I am instead noting the memory-model consequences of a few potential levels of ambition, ranging from \"portions of a few drivers\", \"a few drivers\", \"some core code\" and up to and including \"the entire kernel\". Greater levels of ambition will require greater willingness to accommodate a wider variety of LKMM [Linux-kernel memory model] requirements.\n\n[...]\nThese blog posts will therefore present approaches ranging upwards from trivial workarounds. But be warned that some of the high-quality approaches require profound reworking of compiler backends that have thus far failed to spark joy in the hearts of compiler writers. In addition, Rust enjoys considerable use outside of the Linux kernel, for example, as something into which to rewrite inefficient Python scripts. (A megawatt here, a megawatt there, and pretty soon you are talking about real power consumption!) Therefore, there are probably sharp limits beyond which the core Rust developers are unwilling to go.",

Building from source in a user-verifiable manner is part of the philosophy behind Guix, but there were a number of problems that were encountered:\n\nThe first surprise when starting packaging PyTorch is that, despite being on PyPI, PyTorch is first and foremost a large C++ code base. It does have a setup.py as commonly found in pure Python packages, but that file delegates the bulk of the work to CMake.\n\nThe second surprise is that PyTorch bundles (or \"vendors\", as some would say) source code for no less than 41 dependencies, ranging from small Python and C++ helper libraries to large C++ neural network tools. Like other distributions such as Debian, Guix avoids bundling: we would rather have one Guix package for each of these dependencies. The rationale is manifold, but it boils down to keeping things auditable, reducing resource usage, and making security updates practical.",

By\ncoincidence I happened to be thinking about code names myself while\nrecently replaying XCOM: Enemy Within (2012/2013). The game\ngenerates a random code name for each mission, and I wondered how often it\nrepeats. The UFOpaedia page on the topic gives the word lists: 53\nadjectives and 76 nouns, for a total of 4028 possible code names. A\ntypical game has around 60 missions, and if code names are generated\nnaively on the fly, then per the birthday paradox around half of all games\nwill see a repeated mission code name! Fortunately this is easy to avoid,\nand the particular configuration here lends itself to an interesting\nimplementation.\nMission code names are built using “adjective noun”. Some examples\nfrom the game’s word list:…",
