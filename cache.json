Kai integrates large language models (LLMs) with static code analysis to facilitate code modifications within a developer's IDE, helping transition to other modern programming languages and frameworks efficiently. \nUsing a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach, Kai enhances LLM outputs with historical code changes and analysis data, ensuring context-specific guidance. This method is model agnostic and does not require model fine-tuning, making Kai a versatile tool for large-scale modernization projects, demonstrated by updating a Java EE application to Quarkus using a Visual Studio Code (VS Code) plug-in.

          "description": "Crazy idea of the day: Static Analysis Ranked Defect List.\n\n\n\nHere is a software analysis tool feature request/product idea: So many times we see the problem that a static analysis tool or other way of automatically finding bugs inundates developers with so many possible bugs they turn it off in frustration. Or maybe they have a requirement to ship only \"clean\" code so they don't run the tool because then there is nothing to clean up.  Put your favorite head-in-the-sand organizational dysfunction here.\n\n\nI'd love to be able to recommend a static analysis or other tool that has a feature that reports that top 10 defects currently in the code base, ranked by likely risk. Go ahead and use machine learning for the ranking; fine with me. Regardless of methodology, fixing only some is a guess after all.\n\n\nUltimately, all the static analysis warnings should be cleaned up. Having a \"top K warnings\" feature would allow a team to make progress over time instead of simply sweeping the entire mess under the carpet and ignoring what is often very valuable information that predicts defect escapes to deployment.\n\n\nFor tools with many warnings an approximation can be to gradually turn on a series of warning flags over time and/or just run the warnings on a subset of modules. But a global \"these are the 10 scariest warnings\" would be a nice feature.\n\n\nThoughts?  Does some tool already do this?",

The key insight originated from a reader suggestion\nabout dynamic arrays. The subject of concatenation can be a string,\ndynamic array, or even something else. The “system” is extensible, and\nespecially useful for path handling.\nContinuing from last time, the examples are in light, C-style C++.\nI chose it because templates and function overloading express the concepts\nsuccinctly. It uses no standard library functionality, so converting to C,\nor similar, should be straightforward.
