Because load isn't, in general, evenly balanced across shards and the shard-level degradation in performance is so severe when we exceed 50% CPU utilization, this makes the prac‚Ä¶",

The cost of copying data to be transmitted\nfrom user space into the kernel can be especially painful; it adds latency,\ntakes\nvaluable CPU time, and can be hard on cache performance.  So it is\nunsurprising that the developers working with io_uring, which is all about performance, have\nturned their attention to zero-copy network transmission.  This\npatch set from Pavel Begunkov, now in its second revision, looks to be\nsignificantly faster than the MSG_ZEROCOPY option supported by current\nkernels.",

Once they grasp the concept of the decimal system, the addition and subtraction activities, also based on math manipulation, help practice arithmetic.\n\nAlong with other classics, like chess, align four, and checkers, fans of strategy games will enjoy Oware, a game that requires forethought and, again, numeracy skills.

Kids These Days want nothing to do with it, and\nemail has lost its charm with many others as well.\nBut many development projects are still dependent on it, and even\nnon-developers still cope with large volumes of mail.  While development\nforges show one possible path away from email, they are not the only one.\nWhat if new structures could be built on top of email to address some of\nits worst problems while keeping the good parts that many projects depend\non?  The \"lei\" system recently launched by Konstantin Ryabitsev is a hint\nof how such a future might look.",
