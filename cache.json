Fortunately, since C++20, we have a reliable and simple technique from the std::filesystem and std::chrono components.\nLet’s jump in.\n\n\n\n     \n    \n\n\nIn C++, working with files was usually reserved for OS APIs and third-party libraries. Here are two examples of such an approach:\n\n\n\n     \n    \n\n\nIn Linux or any POSIX-compliant system, you can use the stat function to get file times.\n#include <iostream>\n#include <fstream>\n#include <sys/stat.h>\n#include <ctime>\n\nint main() {\n    const char* file_path = \"example.txt\";\n    std::ofstream(file_path) << \"Hello, World!\";\n\n    struct stat file_stat;\n\n    if (stat(file_…",

One thing I find interesting about discussions of bias is how different the reaction is in the LLM and generative AI case when compared to \"classical\" bugs in cases where there's a clear bug. In particular, if you look at forums or other discussions with lay people, people frequently deny that a model which produces output that's sort of the opposite of what the user asked for is even a bug. For example, a year ago, an Asian MIT grad student asked Playground AI (PAI) to \"Give the girl from the original photo a professional linkedin profile photo\" and PAI converted her face to a white face with blue eyes.\nThe top \"there's no bias\" response on the front-page reddit story, and one of th…",

          "description": "In my previous articles, I explained how to implement a canary deployment strategy with OpenShift Service Mesh and another article with Argo Rollouts. In this article, we will walk through the same example, this time using both technologies: Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh and Argo Rollouts.\nArgo Rollouts is a Kubernetes controller and set of CRDs that provide advanced deployment capabilities such as blue/green, canary, canary analysis, experimentation, and progressive delivery features to Kubernetes. In this demo, we are going to use canary capabilities. \nYou can also check this other article for a blue/green deployment strategy with Argo Rollouts.\nIn the next sections, we will see a real example of how to install, deploy, and manage the life cycle of cloud-native applications doing canary…",

For a deeper dive, I recommend going straight to the upstream documentation page. The upstream email list is shenandoah-dev@openjdk.org.\nAbout Shenandoah GC\nHere is a very quick summary of Shenandoah's key characteristics:\n\nConcurrent: This means the application runs together with the garbage collection.\nLocation-based GC: Forwarding pointers enable Shenandoah to collect each region independently without remembered sets.\nNot generational-based: This means the log does not have Young, Tenure, or Old divisions; Therefo…",

          "description": "The interaction of AI/ML and edge computing occurs in a variety of businesses. For example, in the retail industry, customer behavior and patterns can be used to determine promotions. In a manufacturing facility, likewise, data inference can help improve processes where machines are failing, products are not up to standard, and so on. The basic premise is that you might collect data and then infer from it in order to make decisions based on it.\nIn the context of this retail use case example, a superstore company has branches spread across the country. Each branch decides the products it wants to sell and can customize an AI/ML intelligent app for customers to use.\nThis article presents a video demonstration illustrating an opinionated solution capable of automating a continuous cycle for r…",

          "description": "There are few topics as arcane as memory models, so it was a pleasant surprise\nwhen the double-length session on the BPF memory model at the\nLinux Storage,\nFilesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit turned out to be\nunderstandable. Paul McKenney led the session, although he was clear that the\nwork he was presenting was also due to Puranjay Mohan, who unfortunately could\nnot attend the summit.\nBPF does not actually have a formalized memory model yet;\ninstead it has relied on a history of talks like this one and a general informal understanding.\nUnfortunately, ignoring memory models does not make them go away, and this has\nalready caused at least one BPF-related bug on weakly-ordered architectures.\nFiguring out what a formal memory model for BPF should define was the focus of\nMcKenney's talk.",

The key insight originated from a reader suggestion\nabout dynamic arrays. The subject of concatenation can be a string,\ndynamic array, or even something else. The “system” is extensible, and\nespecially useful for path handling.\nContinuing from last time, the examples are in light, C-style C++.\nI chose it because templates and function overloading express the concepts\nsuccinctly. It uses no standard library functionality, so converting to C,\nor similar, should be straightforward.
