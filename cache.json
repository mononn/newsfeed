Usually, we can depend on some library or OS-specific code to get that file property. Fortunately, since C++20, we have a reliable and simple technique from the std::filesystem and std::chrono components.\nLet’s jump in.\n\n\n\n     \n    \n\n\nIn C++, working with files was usually reserved for OS APIs and third-party libraries. Here are two examples of such an approach:\n\n\n\n     \n    \n\n\nIn Linux or any POSIX-compliant system, you can use the stat function to get file times.\n#include <iostream>\n#include <fstream>\n#include <sys/stat.h>\n#include <ctime>\n\nint main() {\n    const char* file_path = \"example.txt\";\n    std::ofstream(file_path) << \"Hello, World!\";\n\n    struct stat file_stat;\n\n    if (stat(file_…",

One thing I find interesting about discussions of bias is how different the reaction is in the LLM and generative AI case when compared to \"classical\" bugs in cases where there's a clear bug. In particular, if you look at forums or other discussions with lay people, people frequently deny that a model which produces output that's sort of the opposite of what the user asked for is even a bug. For example, a year ago, an Asian MIT grad student asked Playground AI (PAI) to \"Give the girl from the original photo a professional linkedin profile photo\" and PAI converted her face to a white face with blue eyes.\nThe top \"there's no bias\" response on the front-page reddit story, and one of th…",

          "description": "Managing environments efficiently has become a significant challenge for DevOps engineers, platform engineers, and developers. The concept of Environment as a Service (EaaS) promises agility and scalability but is often challenged with the complexities of provisioning, de-provisioning, applying consistent configurations across namespaces, and managing Day 2 operations. Some of the challenges include ensuring isolation between teams, managing access controls and automating the environment life cycles to support CI/CD (continuous integration/continuous deployment). As organizations strive to streamline these processes, the need for a product that can offer simple, efficient, flexible and expandable solutions is very important. \nIn this article, we will explore how the Multi Tenant Operator b…",

Which is why they're\nhighlighted now - if you bring the tool into proximity, the matching\nimage is highlighted to make it easier to know which stylus you're\nabout to configure.
