My name is Volodymyr, and in this post I would like to talk about the project I have been working on for the past couple of months as part of Google Summer of Code 2024. The aim of the project was to introduce 3-way comparison intrinsics to LLVM IR and add a decent level of optimizations for them.\nBackground\nThree-way comparison is an operation present in many high-level languages, such as C++ and its spaceship operator or Rust and the Ord trait. It operates on two values for which there is a defined comparison operation and returns -1 if the first operand is less than the second, 0 if they are equal, and 1 otherwise. At the moment, compilers that use LLVM express this operation using different sequences of instructions which are optimized and lowered individually rather th…",

Currently, ClangIR lowersmost functions without accounting for ABI-specific calling convention details.\nGoals\nThe “Build & Run SingleSource Benchmarks with ClangIR - Part 2” Google Summer ofCode 2024 builds on my contributions from GSoC 2023 by addressing one of themain issues I encountered: target-specific lowering.

The objective of this project is to provide an analysis of how time is spent in the optimization pipeline. Generally, drastic differences in the percentage of time spent by a pass in the pipeline is considered abnormal.\nBackground\nIn principle, an LLVM IR bitcode file, or module, contains IR features that determine the behavior of the compiler optimization pipeline. By varying these features, the optimization pipeline, opt, can add significantly to the compilation time or marginally. More specifically, optimizations succeed in less or more time; the user can wait for a microsecond or a few minutes. LLVM compiler developers co…",

The goal of the project was to improve the NewGVN pass so that it can replace GVN as the main value numbering pass in LLVM.\nBackground\nGlobal Value Numbering (GVN) consists of assigning value numbers such that instructions with the same value number are equivalent. NewGVN was introduced in 2016 to replace GVN. We now highlight a few aspects in which NewGVN is better than GVN.\nA key advantage of NewGVN over GVN is that it is complete for loops, while GVN is only complete for acyclical code. NewGVN is complete for loops because when it first processes loops, it assumes that only the first iteration will be executed, later corroborating these assumptions—this is known as the optimistic assumption. In practice, the opti…",

          "description": "As a maintainer of the GCC register allocator (RA), I naturally have a keen interest in the register allocators used in various industrial compilers. For some compilers, like LLVM and Cranelift, there is sufficient documentation, including papers and presentations, to gain a deep understanding of their register allocators (RAs). \nUnfortunately, this is not the case for the Go compiler. To gather information about the RA in the Go compiler, I had to delve into its source code. This article outlines my findings.\nGo's register allocator: A high-level view\nIn summary, the current Go register allocator operates on SSA (Static Single Assignment). The entire Go compiler optimization pipeline operates on SSA.\nTaking a broader view, the current Go register allocator comprises the following componen…",

          "description": "Red Hat OpenShift needs storage for different purposes. One of the major uses is persistent storage for the containerized workload.\nMany applications consume persistent storage to save data that needs to survive beyond the life cycle of the containers. This applies to different types of workloads running on the cluster including databases, messaging systems, and big data solutions, but also for OpenShift cluster components like monitoring, logging, and the internal image registry.\nThere are different access modes from the Red Hat OpenShift cluster to the underlying storage solution. We can find 3 different access modes: ReadWriteMany (RWX), ReadOnlyMany (ROX), and ReadWriteOnce (RWO). Using one of them versus another depends on the application needs and on the storage exposed to the Red Ha…",

The last problem was a\nbit trickier, but he has a clever workaround for that, based on tricking\nthe compiler into inlining the helper functions across language boundaries.",
