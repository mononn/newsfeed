Usually, we can depend on some library or OS-specific code to get that file property. Fortunately, since C++20, we have a reliable and simple technique from the std::filesystem and std::chrono components.\nLet’s jump in.\n\n\n\n     \n    \n\n\nIn C++, working with files was usually reserved for OS APIs and third-party libraries. Here are two examples of such an approach:\n\n\n\n     \n    \n\n\nIn Linux or any POSIX-compliant system, you can use the stat function to get file times.\n#include <iostream>\n#include <fstream>\n#include <sys/stat.h>\n#include <ctime>\n\nint main() {\n    const char* file_path = \"example.txt\";\n    std::ofstream(file_path) << \"Hello, World!\";\n\n    struct stat file_stat;\n\n    if (stat(file_…",

One thing I find interesting about discussions of bias is how different the reaction is in the LLM and generative AI case when compared to \"classical\" bugs in cases where there's a clear bug. In particular, if you look at forums or other discussions with lay people, people frequently deny that a model which produces output that's sort of the opposite of what the user asked for is even a bug. For example, a year ago, an Asian MIT grad student asked Playground AI (PAI) to \"Give the girl from the original photo a professional linkedin profile photo\" and PAI converted her face to a white face with blue eyes.\nThe top \"there's no bias\" response on the front-page reddit story, and one of th…",

          "description": "Using Argo CD to manage your Kubernetes ecosystem is an excellent GitOps approach to continuous deployment (CD). However, it can pose challenges when trying to manage multiple Kubernetes manifests for deployments, services, secrets, configurations, and other files within your Git repository.\nUnlike an Argo CD Application resource that deploys resources from a single Git repository in a single cluster or namespace, ApplicationSet expands upon this use case. An ApplicationSet utilizes template-based automation to create, modify, and manage multiple Argo CD applications simultaneously, targeting multiple clusters and namespaces.\nIn what situations is it more convenient to use an ApplicationSet?\n\n\n\nIt is convenient to use an ApplicationSet when a user or team has too many applications to manag…",

When a task becomes runnable, the core kernel\n\tscheduler calls sched_class.enqueue(rq, p, flags) so the\n\tconcrete scheduling policy enqueues task p to run queue\n\trq.

          "description": "I’ve come across two approaches to video synchronization.  The first, used by\na lot of the Xilinx IP I’ve come across, is to hold the video pipeline in\nreset until everything is ready and then release the resets (in the right and\nproper order) to get the design started.  If something goes wrong, however,\nthere’s no room for recovery.  The second approach is the approach I like to\nuse, which is to build video components that are inherently\n“stable”: 1) if they\never lose synchronization, they will naturally work their way back into\nsynchronization, and 2) once synchronized they will not get out of sync.\nAt least that’s the goal.  It’s a great goal, too–when it works.\nToday’s story is about what happens when a “robust” video display isn’t.\nSystem Overview\nLet’s start at the top level: I’m wor…",
