Imagine instead being able to use state-of-the-art free AI coding assistants right on your local machine using powerful open source models, with auto-completions and confidence that your data stays private! \nLet’s take a look at how to integrate an AI code assistant into your IDE using a combination of open source tools, including Continue (an extension for VS Code and JetBrains), Ollama or InstructLab as a local model server, and the Granite family of code models to supercharge your development workflow without any cost …",

Data used to train these models is usually scraped from the internet which often contains toxic content. Without proper guardrails, a model can learn undesirable properties and in turn, generate toxic text. Removing toxic samples from training data can be expensive as it usually requires data annotators to manually identify samples that align with human values. Inherent bias in the annotators themselves can also affect the data labeling process in a negative way. By using the open source project TrustyAI Detoxify in conjunction with Hugging Face's SFTTrainer (Supervised Fine-Tuning Trainer) on Red Hat OpenShift AI, we can help lower the costs of detoxifying LLMs during training. \nIn this ar…",

Creating a heap dump on production can (and most of the time will) directly impact the Java Virtual Machine's (JVM) performance for a few seconds of applications deployed. \nTo reduce the overhead of usage (i.e., overhead on data capture), one alternative is to use a lower overhead capturing framework such as Java Flight Recording (JFR) data. This data can be later analyzed offline and used to track down memory usage, high CPU utilization, and thread inspection, for example. But it can be even more useful depending on the events it records. \nFor Red Hat OpenShift deployments, you can collect data via the Red Hat build of Cryostat Operator, which …",

OCSP was developed as a\nlighter-weight alternative to\n\nCertificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) that did not involve downloading\nthe entire CRL in order to check whether a certificate was valid. Let's Encrypt will continue\nsupporting OCSP as long as it is a requirement for Microsoft's\n\nTrusted Root Program, but hopes to discontinue it soon:\n\n\n\nWe plan to end support for OCSP primarily because it represents a considerable risk to privacy on the Internet. When someone visits a website using a browser or other software that checks for certificate revocation via OCSP, the Certificate Authority (CA) operating the OCSP responder immediately becomes aware of which website is being visited from that visitor's particular IP address. Even when a CA intentionally does not retain this information, as is the case with Let's Encrypt, CAs could be legally compelled to collect it. CRLs do not have this issue.\n\n\n\nPeople using Let's Encrypt as their CA should, for the most part, not need to change their setups.\nAll modern browsers support CRLs, so end-users shouldn't notice an impact either.",

Fedora Magazine has a\npost by Timothée Ravier about the problem, how users can work\naround it, and what the project is doing to avoid the similar problems\nin the future:\nOn Fedora Atomic Desktops and Fedora IoT systems, the components\nthat are part of the boot chain (Shim, GRUB) are not (yet)\nautomatically updated alongside the rest of the system. Thus, if you\nhave installed a Fedora Atomic Desktop or a Fedora IoT system before\nFedora 40, it uses an old versions of the Shim and bootloader binaries\nto boot your system.\nWhen Secure Boot is enabled, the EFI firmware loads Shim\nfirst. Shim is signed by the Microsoft Third Party Certificate\nAuthority so that it can be verified on most hardware out of the\nbox. The Shim binary includes the Fedora certificates used to verify\nbinaries signed by Fedora. Then Shim loads GRUB, which in turn loads\nthe Linux kernel. Both are signed by Fedora.\nUntil recently, the kernel binaries where signed two times, with an\nolder key and a newer one. With the 6.9 kernel update, the kernel is\nno longer signed with the old key. If GRUB or Shim is old enough and\ndoes not know about the new key, the signature verification fails.",

The Free & Open Source stack supports all of these advances at the lower level, but application UI support has been slower to arrive. The Open Source text stack also gained enormous market-share when Android and Google Chrome fully embraced it.\n\nLooking forward, there is a Rust migration of the text stack underway, which will unify font compilation and consumption under a safe programming language. Incremental Font Transfer will enable streaming fonts to web browsers. And my proposed Wasm-fonts will enable more expressive fonts.",

This can extend to affecting legal decisions, such as suggesting sentencing guidelines to judges.\nFaced with these concerns, there is often a movement to restrict the use of algorithms, such as a recent activity in New York to restrict how social media networks generate feeds for children.

          "description": "A while ago I already looked into Avast Secure Browser. Back then it didn’t end well for Avast: I found critical vulnerabilities allowing arbitrary websites to infect user’s computer. Worse yet: much of it was due to neglect of secure coding practices, existing security mechanisms were disabled for no good reason. I didn’t finish that investigation because I discovered that the browser was essentially spyware, collecting your browsing history and selling it via Avast’s Jumpshot subsidiary.\nBut that was almost five years ago. After an initial phase of denial, Avast decided to apologize and to wind down Jumpshot. It was certainly a mere coincidence that Avast was subsequently sold to NortonLifeLock, called Gen Digital today. Yes, Avast is truly reformed and paying for their crimes in Europe …",
