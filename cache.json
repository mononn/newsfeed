The techniques are very similar to std::optional extensions - see How to Use Monadic Operations for `std::optional` in C++23 - C++ Stories.\nHere’s a brief overview of these functional capabilities:\nUpdate: Thanks to prof.

Since then, most engineers have embraced this microservices architecture. Microservices help divide a single monolithic application into small units, each acting as a service to deliver specific functions.\nFor companies transitioning from on-premise software to a hybrid cloud infrastructure, refactoring the application from a monolith into microservices offers several advantages. The microservice architecture isolates services, allowing companies to loosely coupled software components. This flexibility enables deploying and running specific services on premise or in the cloud as part of a hybrid setup. Consequently, companies can keep personal …",

A huge benefit of this layer structure is that, assuming that each image layer stores only the differences compared to the previous layer (i.e., the delta), each layer is small which generally allows time and space savings when building and running containers.

          "description": "Crazy idea of the day: Static Analysis Ranked Defect List.\n\n\n\nHere is a software analysis tool feature request/product idea: So many times we see the problem that a static analysis tool or other way of automatically finding bugs inundates developers with so many possible bugs they turn it off in frustration. Or maybe they have a requirement to ship only \"clean\" code so they don't run the tool because then there is nothing to clean up.  Put your favorite head-in-the-sand organizational dysfunction here.\n\n\nI'd love to be able to recommend a static analysis or other tool that has a feature that reports that top 10 defects currently in the code base, ranked by likely risk. Go ahead and use machine learning for the ranking; fine with me. Regardless of methodology, fixing only some is a guess after all.\n\n\nUltimately, all the static analysis warnings should be cleaned up. Having a \"top K warnings\" feature would allow a team to make progress over time instead of simply sweeping the entire mess under the carpet and ignoring what is often very valuable information that predicts defect escapes to deployment.\n\n\nFor tools with many warnings an approximation can be to gradually turn on a series of warning flags over time and/or just run the warnings on a subset of modules. But a global \"these are the 10 scariest warnings\" would be a nice feature.\n\n\nThoughts?  Does some tool already do this?",

          "description": "The Amarok music player project\nhas announced\nthe release of version 3.0, which is codenamed \"Castaway\".  It is the first\nstable version using Qt 5 and KDE Frameworks 5, and the first stable\nrelease since the final Qt-4-based 2.9.0 in 2018.\n\nThe road to 3.0 has not been a short one. Much of the Qt5/KF5 porting was done in 2015 already, but finishing and polishing everything up has been a slow, sometimes ongoing and sometimes stalled process ever since. 3.0 Alpha was released in February 2021 and has been since used by many people, as have been nightly builds of git master available for various distributions. Now in the past few months, an effort was made to get everything ready for a proper 3.0 release.\n\nCommon usecases should work quite well, and in addition to fixing KF5 port\nrelated regressions reported in pre-releases, 3.0 features many bugfixes\nand implemented features for longstanding issues, the oldest such\ndocumented being from 2009. However, with more than 20 years of development\nhistory, it is likely that not every feature Amarok has been tested\nthoroughly in the new release, and specifically some Internet services that\nhave changed their API in recent years are not available, at least for\nnow. It might well be that getting them in better state wouldn't require\nhuge effort, however, so if you know your way with Qt and KDE Frameworks\nand your favourite Internet music service does not work with Amarok 3.0,\nyou are extremely welcome to join in and help!",
