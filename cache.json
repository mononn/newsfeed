This low-level, high-performance API offers significant advantages over previous methods, such as atoi and stringstream. In this article, we will explore the evolution of string conversion routines from C++17 through C++26, highlighting key improvements like constexpr support and enhanced error handling. Let’s dive into the details and see how std::from_chars can transform your approach to string conversion.\nUpdated in Oct 2024: Added notes from constexpr support in C++23, and C++26 improvements, plus more Compiler Explorer examples.\n\n\n\n     \n    \n\n\nC++, before C++17, offered several options when it comes to string conversion:\nsprintf / snp…",

My name is Volodymyr, and in this post I would like to talk about the project I have been working on for the past couple of months as part of Google Summer of Code 2024. The aim of the project was to introduce 3-way comparison intrinsics to LLVM IR and add a decent level of optimizations for them.\nBackground\nThree-way comparison is an operation present in many high-level languages, such as C++ and its spaceship operator or Rust and the Ord trait. It operates on two values for which there is a defined comparison operation and returns -1 if the first operand is less than the second, 0 if they are equal, and 1 otherwise. At the moment, compilers that use LLVM express this operation using different sequences of instructions which are optimized and lowered individually rather th…",

The objective of this project is to provide an analysis of how time is spent in the optimization pipeline. Generally, drastic differences in the percentage of time spent by a pass in the pipeline is considered abnormal.\nBackground\nIn principle, an LLVM IR bitcode file, or module, contains IR features that determine the behavior of the compiler optimization pipeline. By varying these features, the optimization pipeline, opt, can add significantly to the compilation time or marginally.

In this article, we briefly cover these expanders and their utility.\nWhat is Cluster Autoscaler?\nOpenShift uses Cluster Autoscaler to adjust cluster size based on resource requirements of workloads. The Cluster Autoscaler uses expanders strategies to decide which node group should be expanded when additional resources are required.

In this series, I’ll guide you through everything you need to know about internal developer portals, starting from scratch and moving towards advanced integrations and optimizations.\nThis article sets the foundation by exploring what internal developer portals are, the value they bring, and why Red Hat Developer Hub (Backstage) is a game changer for your development teams. Let’s find out.\nWhich problem(s) are we facing?\nComing from a software development background, I’ve encountered the same challenges across multiple organizations (and I’m sure you have, too).

They are the foundation of several natural language processing (NLP) applications such as Retrieval Augmentation Generation. Caikit NLP is a toolkit/runtime that provides modules and exposes inference endpoints for large language models (LLMs).\nIn this tutorial, we will serve a Sentence Transformer model using the Caikit Standalone serving runtime.

The bootc project is the core technology that enables OCI containers to encompass complete operating systems, and it is the heart of image mode for Red Hat Enterprise Linux. \nI believe that bootable containers will change how we think about the IT infrastructure of the future. To help users understand and use bootable containers, we have created a getting started guide in the upstream Fedora documentation. This post is meant to introduce you to the basic concepts and help you navigate the rest of the documentation.\n\n\n\n  \n        \n\n\n\n  \n\nFigure 1: Applications containers share the kernel of the underlying OS. Bootable containers include a kernel as they define the underlying OS.\n\nGet started with bootc with video demos\nTo make things a bit more interactive, I have recorded a presentation based on the Fedora getting started guide.\n\n  \n      \n  \n\n\n\n  \nI further sat down and recorded a hands-on demo working with bootable containers on my Mac that includes building a bootc image, running it in a VM on my machine and updating it.\n\n  \n      \n  \n\n\n\n  \nGet support and share feedback\nIf you have any questions or feedback, feel more than welcome to join the conversation on Fedora Discussion and the bootc community.\nbootc: Getting started with bootable containers appeared first on Red Hat Developer.",

One of the major uses is persistent storage for the containerized workload.\nMany applications consume persistent storage to save data that needs to survive beyond the life cycle of the containers. This applies to different types of workloads running on the cluster including databases, messaging systems, and big data solutions, but also for OpenShift cluster components like monitoring, logging, and the internal image registry.\nThere are different access modes from the Red Hat OpenShift cluster to the underlying storage solution.

To fix the first two problems, Guo proposed\nchanging the way the kernel maps C types into Rust types. The last problem was a\nbit trickier, but he has a clever workaround for that, based on tricking\nthe compiler into inlining the helper functions across language boundaries.",

Tails had outgrown its existing structure. Rather than expanding Tails's operational capacity on their own and putting more stress on Tails workers, merging with the Tor Project, with its larger and established operational framework, offered a solution.

There are multiple ways this could be done,\nand the most obvious is the process’s active code page (ACP), which is\nexactly what happens. As a consequence, the specific DLL loaded by the\nlinker may depend on the system code page. In this article I’ll contrive\nsuch a situation.\nLoadLibraryA is a similar situation, and potentially applies the code\npage to a longer portion of the module path. LoadLibraryW is\nunaffected, at least for the directly-named module, because it’s Unicode\nall the way through.…",
