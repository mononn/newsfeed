This was a 30 min drive.  My father would drop us off in the morning and pick us up in the late afternoon.  He spend two hours in his car each Saturday hauling us around.\nThanks Dad!\nTim and I would spend our day \"playing\" with the floor model of the PDP-8 they had at the office.  The office staff were very accommodating and accepting of our presence, and they helped us out if we needed any fresh rolls of teleprinter paper, or paper tape.\nSeveral years later, at the age of 20, I found myself working at Teradyne Applied Systems in Chicago.  The computer we used there was called an M365; but it was really just an upgraded PDP-8.  We used it to…",

The FMN program mission is to foster a thriving worldwide community of Flutter developers by empowering community organizers to educate and inspire local communities with engaging events.\nMeetups – and similar developer community groups - are a great resource. As Flutter has grown in popularity over the past few years, over 100 Meetup groups have sprung up organically around the world to celebrate and educate their members about Flutter. The volunteers who run these groups have hosted many awesome events and workshops. \n    \nWe, in the Flutter team, see and appreciate these amazing communities. 💙 The Flutter Meetup Network (FMN) is now being launched to support these groups officially. Network members will have access to various resources (more details available soon!), making it easier to plan and host Flutter-themed events. \nMeetups have many benefits, aside from networking. When stuck on an issue in your current Flutter project, chances are good that you can find a developer in your local Flutter Meetup who has solved a similar problem. Or, maybe they know the perfect package for your needs. \nWe are thrilled to support our amazing and passionate organizers and can’t wait to see what the Flutter Meetup Network does moving forward. \nJoin a Meetup near you! https://www.meetup.com/pro/flutter",

Users have never been more comfortable bringing home new smart home devices — but they also continue to expect more from their devices, and their smart homes. To meet and exceed these expectations,   we want to make sure developers have the tools and support to build their best experience across the Google Home app, Nest, Android, and Assistant.  \nThat’s why we’re excited to announce the return of the Google Smart Home Developer Summit on October 21, 2021! This year’s event is free to join, fully virtual and will be hosted on our website with broadcast times available for our developer communities in the AMER, EMEA, and APAC regions. \nTo kick things off, Michele Turner, Senior Director of Product for Google’s Smart Home Ecosystem, will share our vision for the home and preview upcoming tools and features to build your next devices and apps using Matter and Thread — technologies transforming the industry. This will be followed by a developer keynote to dig deeper into announcements, and a round of technical sessions, workshops, and more, hosted by Google's smart home leaders. \nBuilding the best smart home platform means using trusted technology and intelligence to develop your integrations faster, provide tools to drive your innovation, and allow you new paths to growth. We can’t wait to engage with you and share more about how we can lead and grow the smart home together. \nYou can register for the Google Smart Home Developer Summit 2021 here, and follow along with the event using the tag #GoogleHomeSummit on social media.

Join us to hear about the latest updates in Android development, centered on this year’s theme: excellent apps, across devices. We have over 30 sessions on a range of technical Android development topics. Plus, we’ve assembled the team that builds Android to get your burning #AskAndroid questions answered live. Interested in learning more? Be sure to sign up for updates through our Android newsletter here. \nDiscover, Connect, Inspire at Chrome Dev Summit 2021\nThe countdown to Chrome Dev Summit 2021 is on — and we can’t wait to share what we have in store. We’ll kick things off on November 3 by sharing the latest product updates in our keynote and hosting a live ask me anything (AMA) with Chrome leaders. You’ll also have the chance to chat live with Googlers and developers around the world, participate in workshops with industry experts, attend interactive learning lounges to consult with engineers in a group setting, and receive personalized support during one-on-one office hours. Everyone can tune into the keynote and AMA, but space is limited for the workshops, office hours, and learning lounges. Request an invite to secure your spot — we’ll see you on November 3! \nAnd follow the Firebase Twitter channel for more updates on Firebase Summit, which will be coming to you on November 10!",

Google App Engine, our first Cloud product, was created to give users the ability to deploy source-based web applications or mobile backends directly to the cloud without the need of thinking about servers or scaling. Cloud Functions came later for scenarios where you may not have an entire app, great for one-off utility functions or event-driven microservices.

Building from source in a user-verifiable manner is part of the philosophy behind Guix, but there were a number of problems that were encountered:\n\nThe first surprise when starting packaging PyTorch is that, despite being on PyPI, PyTorch is first and foremost a large C++ code base. It does have a setup.py as commonly found in pure Python packages, but that file delegates the bulk of the work to CMake.\n\nThe second surprise is that PyTorch bundles (or \"vendors\", as some would say) source code for no less than 41 dependencies, ranging from small Python and C++ helper libraries to large C++ neural network tools. Like other distributions such as Debian, Guix avoids bundling: we would rather have one Guix package for each of these dependencies. The rationale is manifold, but it boils down to keeping things auditable, reducing resource usage, and making security updates practical.",

SBOMs are used as a part of a foundational practice to track and trace components across software supply chains. SBOMs also help to proactively identify software issues and risks and establish a starting point for their remediation.\n\nSPDX results from ten years of collaboration from representatives across industries, including the leading Software Composition Analysis (SCA) vendors – making it the most robust, mature, and adopted SBOM standard.",

          "description": "Two recent threads on the python-ideas mailing list have overlapped to a\ncertain extent; both referred to Python's style guide, but the discussion\nindicates that the advice in it may have been stretched further than intended.   PEP 8\n(\"Style Guide for Python Code\") is the longstanding set of\nguidelines and suggestions for code that is going into the standard\nlibrary, but the \"rules\" in the PEP have been applied in settings and tools well outside of that\nrealm.  There may be reasons to update the PEP—some unrelated work of that nature is\nongoing, in fact—but Pythonistas need to remember that the suggestions in\nit are not carved in stone.",

          "description": "중국철학이나 동양철학에 대해서 외경심을 갖고 연구하라. 아마 서양 철학자들이 중국에 철학이 없다. 기껏해야 공자에서 볼 수 있듯이 삶의 지혜처럼 보이는 동네 늙은이의 인생에 대한 언명들이 있을 뿐이라는 혹독한 비판에 대한 대응이 이것일 것이다. 존경하라. 중국의 철학이란 그런 시시한 것이 아니다. 존경하고 공감하고 동정(同情)하면 어떤 보석을 발견할 것이다. 그러나 이러한 요구는 그렇게 바람직하지 못하다고 생각한다. 외경과 공감을 요구하기 전에, 외경하고 공감할 수밖에 없는 것을 보여주면 된다. 따라서 그것을 보고 존경하고 공감할 수밖에 없게 만들면 된다. 풍우란에 대한 한 글이 풍우란의 독창적 철학, 신리학(新理.......",
