          "description": "Annotations in Python came late to the party; they were introduced in\nPython 3 as a way to attach information to functions describing their arguments and\nreturn values.  While that mechanism had obvious applications for adding\ntype information to Python functions, standardized interpretations for the\nannotations came later with type hints.\nBut evaluating the annotations at function-definition time caused some\ndifficulties, especially with respect to forward references to type names,\nso a Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) was created to postpone their\nevaluation until they were needed. The PEP-described behavior was set to\nbecome the default in the upcoming Python 3.10 release, but that is\nnot to be; the postponement of evaluation by default has itself been postponed in the\nhopes of unwinding things.",

          "description": "The seccomp()\nmechanism allows a process to load a BPF program to restrict its future use\nof system calls; it is a simple but flexible sandboxing mechanism that is\nwidely used.  Those filter programs, though, run on the \"classic\" BPF virtual\nmachine, rather than the extended BPF\n(eBPF) machine used elsewhere in the \nkernel.  Moving seccomp() to eBPF has been an often-requested\nchange, but security concerns have prevented that from happening.  The\nlatest attempt to enable eBPF is this patch\nset from YiFei Zhu; whether it will succeed where others have failed\nremains to be seen.",

The most common example is NUMA\narchitectures, where memory attached to the local node is faster to access\nthan memory on other nodes.  Recently, persistent memory has\nstarted appearing in deployed systems as well; this type of memory is\nbyte-addressable like DRAM, but it is available in larger sizes and is slower to\naccess, especially for \nwrites. This new memory type makes memory allocation even more complicated\nfor the kernel, driving the need for a method to better manage multiple types of\nmemory in one system.",

At the time of this writing, a few from day 2 are ready as well.  There are lots of interesting topics discussed at the summit, including a talk on making CPython faster from Python creator Guido van Rossum. \"Seven months ago, Guido van Rossum left a brief retirement to work at Microsoft. He was given the freedom to pick a project and decided to work on making CPython faster. Microsoft will be funding a small team consisting of Guido van Rossum, Mark Shannon, Eric Snow, and possibly others. [...] The team is optimistic about doubling CPython's speed for 3.11. They plan to try an adaptive, specializing byte code interpreter, which is a bit like the existing inline cache and a bit like the shadow byte code covered in Dino Viehland's talk.\"  Some of the ideas go back to Shannon's thoughts on speeding up the interpreter that we looked at back in December.",
