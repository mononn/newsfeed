          "description": "When searching for examples of HTTP basic authentication with Go, every result I could find unfortunately contained code which is either out-of-date (i.e. doesn't use the r.BasicAuth() functionality that was introduced in Go 1.4) or is vulnerable to timing attacks.\nSo in this post I'd like to quickly discuss how to implement basic authentication correctly in your Go applications.\nWe'll start with a bit of background information, but if you're not interested in that you can skip straight to the code.\nWhat is basic authentication? When should I use it?\nAs a developer, you're probably already familiar with the prompt that web browsers show when you visit a URL that's protected by basic authentication.\n\nWhen you input a username and password into this prompt, the web browser will send a HTTP r…",

          "description": "One of my favorite things about the recent Go 1.16 release is a small — but very welcome — addition to the flag package: the flag.Func() function. This makes it much easier to define and use custom command-line flags in your application.\nFor example, if you want to parse a flag like --pause=10s directly into a time.Duration type,  or parse --urls=\"http://example.com http://example.org\" directly into a []string slice, then previously you had two options. You could either create a custom type to implement the flag.Value interface, or use a third-party package like pflag.\nBut now the flag.Func() function gives you a simple and lightweight alternative. In this short post we're going to take a look at a few examples of how you can use it in your own code.\nParsing custom flag types\nTo demonstrat…",

          "description": "Posted by Ashley Francisco\n \n The Google for Startups Accelerator: Women Founders program is now open for applications until July 19.\nLast year, we launched the inaugural Google for Startups Accelerator: Women Founders program in North America to help women-led startups identify and solve technical challenges while scaling their companies. The inaugural cohort also received tailored programming to address some of the longstanding barriers that women founders face.  \nWomen founders remain underrepresented in the tech startup ecosystem because they often lack access to the resources needed to start, build, and grow their businesses. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated these structural barriers by disproportionately impacting women in the workforce—and research shows women were more vulnerable to the economic effects of COVID-19 because of existing gender disparities.    \nFor women founders, access to capital is one of the major challenges to launching their business.  A recent report showed women-led startups received a mere 2.3% of global venture capitalist funding in 2020, falling from 2.8% the year before.  \nThe Google for Startups Accelerator: Women Founders program aims to help bridge the gap and create opportunities for women founders to succeed.  Beyond mentorship and technical project support, the accelerator also includes deep dives and workshops focused on product design, customer acquisition, and leadership development for founders. Participants will also hear from a roster of speakers and facilitators who deliver both technical and nontechnical programming for women-led startups.  \nApplications for the second Google for Startups Accelerator: Women Founders program are now open until July 19, for North American applicants. Approximately 10-12 startups with at least one woman founder will be selected from across North America. The accelerator runs from September through to December 2021.  \nTo learn more about the program and to apply, visit the website.",

Rally comes out of work that Mozilla did with Professor Jonathan Mayer's research group at Princeton University .\n\nYour data is valuable. But for too long, online services have pilfered, swapped, and exploited your data without your awareness. Privacy violations and filter bubbles are all consequences of a surveillance data economy. But what if, instead of companies taking your data without giving you a say, you could select who gets access to your data and put it to work for public good?\n\n[...] By leveraging the scale of web browsers – a piece of software used by billions of people around the world – Rally has the potential to help address societal problems we could not solve before. Our goal is to demonstrate that there is a case for an equitable market for data, one where every party is treated fairly, and we welcome mission-aligned organizations that want to join us on this journey.",

Even so, the story of the Landlock security module, developed by\nMickaël Salaün, seems like an extreme case; this code was merged for 5.13 after\nmore than five years of development and 34 versions of the patch set.\nThis sandboxing mechanism has evolved considerably since LWN covered version 3 of the patch set in\n2016, so a look at what Landlock has become is warranted.",

          "description": "The Prossimo project has announced\nthat it has contracted with Miguel Ojeda to work on Rust in the Linux kernel\nfor the next year.  Prossimo is a new name for the memory-safety\nprojects being run by the Internet Security Research\nGroup (ISRG), which is the organization behind the Let's Encrypt certificate authority\n(CA) project.  Google provided the funds to enable Ojeda to work full-time\non the project starting back in April.\n\n\nThe Linux kernel is at the heart of the modern Internet, from\nservers to client devices. It’s on the front line for processing network\ndata and other forms of input. As such, vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel\ncan have a wide-ranging impact, putting security and privacy for people,\norganizations, and devices at risk. Since it’s written largely in the C\nlanguage, which is not memory-safe, memory safety vulnerabilities such as\nbuffer overflows and use-after-frees are a constant concern. By making it\npossible to write parts of the Linux kernel in Rust, which is memory-safe,\nwe can entirely eliminate memory safety vulnerabilities from certain\ncomponents, such as drivers.\n\n\nWe have previously covered another\nProssimo project, which provides funding for\nRustls development, as well as Ojeda's work\non Rust in the kernel.",
