To illustrate, we'll look at how to change this URL:\n\n\n\nTo this:\n\n\n\nIf you want to change the URL query string in place:\n\n  \n\nRunning this will print out:\n\n\n\nIf you want to create a clone of the URL but with a different query string, while leaving the original URL unchanged, you need to create a copy of the original url.URL struct first. \nThere are a couple of ways to do this. You can either re-parse the URL, or you can dereference the original url.URL and make a copy, like so:\n\n\n\nWhen you do this, you create a new newURL variable of type url.URL which is initialized to the (dereferenced) value of *originalURL. This means that newURL has a different address in memory to originalURL.\nPutting this together, the pattern for creating a new URL with different parameters is:\n\n\n\nRunning this will print out:\n\n\n\nAs a side note, you can use this technique any time you want to 'clone' a URL and make changes to it. For example to create a clone of a URL with a different path, you can do this:",

I wrote it in Alcom, which was a simple derivative of Focal, which was an analog of Basic for the PDP-8.  The computer was an M365 which was an augmented version of a PDP-8 and was proprietery to Teradyne, my employer at the time.\nThe UI was screen based, using character graphics, similar to curses.

Because load isn't, in general, evenly balanced across shards and the shard-level degradation in performance is so severe when we exceed 50% CPU utilization, this makes the prac‚Ä¶",

Jami is an end-to-end encrypted\nsecure and distributed voice, video, and chat communication platform\nthat requires no central server, and leaves the power of privacy and\nfreedom in the hands of users.\n\n\nAnother recent blog post gives an overview of Jami for video conferences. The new release has improvements throughout the system, including the first phase of Swarm support, which are \"fully distributed, peer-to-peer chats with conversation\n    histories synchronized across your devices, and the potential to\n    be expanded into group chats in upcoming future releases of Jami\".",

This helps them build a clear concept of the decimal system, and, as with many GCompris activities, an educator can gradually increase the difficulty level, allowing the activities to be used with children of ages between 3 and 10. Once they grasp the concept of the decimal system, the addition and subtraction activities, also based on math manipulation, help practice arithmetic.\n\nAlong with other classics, like chess, align four, and checkers, fans of strategy games will enjoy Oware, a game that requires forethought and, again, numeracy skills.

          "description": "Over on the Project Zero blog, Tavis Ormandy has a lengthy postmortem on a vulnerability that he found in the Network Security Services (NSS) cryptography library.  The vulnerability is a bog-standard buffer overflow that has existed in the library since 2012 despite various kinds of static analysis, testing, and fuzzing that Mozilla and others have applied to it over the years.  He found it with a new fuzzing technique:\n\nTo solve this problem, I‚Äôve been experimenting with monitoring the call stack during execution.\n\nThe naive implementation is too slow to be practical, but after a lot of optimization I had come up with a library that was fast enough to be integrated into coverage-guided fuzzing, and was testing how it performed with NSS and other libraries.\n\n[...] The fuzzer I was using is able to isolate and extract interesting new ASN.1 OIDs, SEQUENCEs, INTEGERs, and so on. Once extracted, it can then randomly combine or insert them into template data. This isn‚Äôt really a new idea, but is a new implementation. I'm planning to open source this code in the future.",
