          "description": "When searching for examples of HTTP basic authentication with Go, every result I could find unfortunately contained code which is either out-of-date (i.e. doesn't use the r.BasicAuth() functionality that was introduced in Go 1.4) or is vulnerable to timing attacks.\nSo in this post I'd like to quickly discuss how to implement basic authentication correctly in your Go applications.\nWe'll start with a bit of background information, but if you're not interested in that you can skip straight to the code.\nWhat is basic authentication? When should I use it?\nAs a developer, you're probably already familiar with the prompt that web browsers show when you visit a URL that's protected by basic authentication.\n\nWhen you input a username and password into this prompt, the web browser will send a HTTP r…",

          "description": "One of my favorite things about the recent Go 1.16 release is a small — but very welcome — addition to the flag package: the flag.Func() function. This makes it much easier to define and use custom command-line flags in your application.\nFor example, if you want to parse a flag like --pause=10s directly into a time.Duration type,  or parse --urls=\"http://example.com http://example.org\" directly into a []string slice, then previously you had two options. You could either create a custom type to implement the flag.Value interface, or use a third-party package like pflag.\nBut now the flag.Func() function gives you a simple and lightweight alternative. In this short post we're going to take a look at a few examples of how you can use it in your own code.\nParsing custom flag types\nTo demonstrat…",

          "description": "Recently I wrote a cute little program for doing Turtle Graphics.  For those of you who don't know, turtle graphics were originally added to the LOGO language by Seymour Papert in the late 1960s.  He built a robot that he called a \"turtle\" that could hold a pen.  The robot had wheels and could move forwards and backwards, and could rotate left and right.  It could also raise and lower the pen.  When placed on a sheet of paper, the turtle could be commanded to draw interesting designs.\nPapert's goal was to teach children about programming.  As the years went by the robot got replaced with screens, and the turtle became an icon that could draw lines.  Children from the 70s until now have been enthralled by the simple commands for directing the turtle, and the elegant drawings they can make.\n…",

The name of the program was: Mr Patternson's Computerized Gate, and it was implemented on a little plastic computer named DIGICOMP-I, which was a cute little three bit finite state machine with 6 AND gates.\nThe first electronic computer I ever wrote a program for was an ECP-18 in 1966.  This was a 15 bit wide machine with 1024 words of drum memory.  The programs I wrote were all in binary machine language and were entered through the front-panel switches.\nIn the years between 1967 and 1969 my father would drive my friend, Tim Conrad, and I 25 miles to the Digital Equipment Corp sales office, where we would spend our Saturdays entering programs into the PDP-8 that they had on the floor.

          "description": "Posted by Charles Maxson, Developer Advocate \n The Google Calendar API has changed how it manages API usage. Previously, queries were monitored and limited on a daily basis. As of May 2021, queries started to be monitored and limited on a per-minute basis. This introduces better behavior when your quota is exceeded, as requests are rate-limited until quota is available rather than failing all requests for the rest of the day. This also helps developers recognize issues around quota enforcements faster and shouldn't affect the performance of existing projects.  \nTo view your usage and quota limits, have a look in the Google API console. \n \n To help you manage your quotas, we’ve put together a few helpful tips: \n \nUse push notifications instead of polling.  \nIf you cannot avoid polling, make sure you only poll when necessary (for example poll very seldomly at night).   \nMake sure to use randomized timing so that requests from your users spread out evenly instead of creating bursts.  \nUse incremental synchronization with sync tokens for all collections instead of repeatedly retrieving all the entries.  \nIncrease page size to retrieve more data at once by using the maxResults parameter.  \nUpdate events when they change, avoid recreating all the events on every sync.  \nUse exponential backoff for error retries to make rate-limiting work properly. \n\nFor further details into managing quotas please review the manage quotas documentation. You can also find more details on error handling on the resolve errors documentation.  \nTo stay on top of news and updates around Google Workspace APIs and developer platform please sign up to our developer newsletter.",

          "description": "Posted by Ashley Francisco\n \n The Google for Startups Accelerator: Women Founders program is now open for applications until July 19.\nLast year, we launched the inaugural Google for Startups Accelerator: Women Founders program in North America to help women-led startups identify and solve technical challenges while scaling their companies. The inaugural cohort also received tailored programming to address some of the longstanding barriers that women founders face.  \nWomen founders remain underrepresented in the tech startup ecosystem because they often lack access to the resources needed to start, build, and grow their businesses. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated these structural barriers by disproportionately impacting women in the workforce—and research shows women were more vulnerable to the economic effects of COVID-19 because of existing gender disparities.    \nFor women founders, access to capital is one of the major challenges to launching their business.  A recent report showed women-led startups received a mere 2.3% of global venture capitalist funding in 2020, falling from 2.8% the year before.  \nThe Google for Startups Accelerator: Women Founders program aims to help bridge the gap and create opportunities for women founders to succeed.  Beyond mentorship and technical project support, the accelerator also includes deep dives and workshops focused on product design, customer acquisition, and leadership development for founders. Participants will also hear from a roster of speakers and facilitators who deliver both technical and nontechnical programming for women-led startups.  \nApplications for the second Google for Startups Accelerator: Women Founders program are now open until July 19, for North American applicants. Approximately 10-12 startups with at least one woman founder will be selected from across North America. The accelerator runs from September through to December 2021.  \nTo learn more about the program and to apply, visit the website.",

It is not ready for prime time, yet, but based on a grant from Zcash Open Major Grants (ZOMG), significant work is ongoing; the plan is \"to try bring Arti to a production-quality client implementation over the next year and a half\".  The C implementation is not going away anytime soon, but the idea is that Arti will eventually supplant it.  The project sees a number of benefits from using Rust, including:\n\n\nFor years now, we've wanted to split Tor's relay cryptography across multiple CPU cores, but we've run into trouble. C's support for thread-safety is quite fragile, and it is very easy to write a program that looks safe to run across multiple threads, but which introduces subtle bugs or security holes. If one thread accesses a piece of state at the same time that another thread is changing it, then your whole program can exhibit some truly confusing and bizarre bugs.\n\nBut in Rust, this kind of bug is easy to avoid: the same type system that keeps us from writing memory unsafety prevents us from writing dangerous concurrent access patterns. Because of that, Arti's circuit cryptography has been multicore from day 1, at very little additional programming effort.",

To the best of my knowledge, this is the first public writeup of a KVM guest-to-host breakout that does not rely on bugs in user space components such as QEMU. The discussed bug was assigned CVE-2021-29657, affects kernel versions v5.10-rc1 to v5.12-rc6 and was patched at the end of March 2021. As the bug only became exploitable in v5.10 and was discovered roughly 5 months later, most real world deployments of KVM should not be affected. I still think the issue is an interesting case study in the work required to build a stable guest-to-host escape against KVM and hope that this writeup can strengthen the case that hypervisor compromises are not only theoretical issues.",

But what if, instead of companies taking your data without giving you a say, you could select who gets access to your data and put it to work for public good?\n\n[...] By leveraging the scale of web browsers – a piece of software used by billions of people around the world – Rally has the potential to help address societal problems we could not solve before. Our goal is to demonstrate that there is a case for an equitable market for data, one where every party is treated fairly, and we welcome mission-aligned organizations that want to join us on this journey.",

Prossimo is a new name for the memory-safety\nprojects being run by the Internet Security Research\nGroup (ISRG), which is the organization behind the Let's Encrypt certificate authority\n(CA) project.  Google provided the funds to enable Ojeda to work full-time\non the project starting back in April.\n\n\nThe Linux kernel is at the heart of the modern Internet, from\nservers to client devices. It’s on the front line for processing network\ndata and other forms of input. As such, vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel\ncan have a wide-ranging impact, putting security and privacy for people,\norganizations, and devices at risk. Since it’s written largely in the C\nlanguage, which is not memory-safe, memory safety vulnerabilities such as\nbuffer overflows and use-after-frees are a constant concern. By making it\npossible to write parts of the Linux kernel in Rust, which is memory-safe,\nwe can entirely eliminate memory safety vulnerabilities from certain\ncomponents, such as drivers.\n\n\nWe have previously covered another\nProssimo project, which provides funding for\nRustls development, as well as Ojeda's work\non Rust in the kernel.",
