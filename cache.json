          "description": "In this post I'd like to talk about one of my favorite architectural patterns for building web applications and APIs in Go. It's kind of a mix between the service object and fat model patterns — so I mentally refer to it as the 'fat service' pattern, but it might have a more formal name that I'm not aware of 🙃\nIt's certainly not a perfect pattern (we'll discuss some of the pros and cons later) — but it is (deliberately) simple, pragmatic, and I find it often works well for small-to-medium sized projects.\nNote: Before we start I'd like to emphasize that there's no single 'correct' way to structure your project in Go. Different architectures suit different projects and teams, and this is just one option to consider.\n\n\nAt a high-level, the fat service pattern splits your project code into tw…",

Two major systems co-exist:\nThe APT package management system for Debian and its many derivatives, notably Ubuntu. Packages are marked with the .deb suffix and are managed through the apt command-line interface (CLI).\nThe RPM package management system for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and its derivatives, notably Fedora and CentO…",

One window will always be a command window, in which you enter the usual GDB commands, but you might also have a source code window, a register contents window, or a disassembly window. Since GDB 11, you can use a Python API to add new window types. This API can be incredibly useful, allowing you to customize GDB to visualize your application's data in new ways.\nNote: The Python API for adding TUI windows was actually added to GDB 10.

While GitHub has its own right to decide what goes on its platform, the disappearance of this source code from GitHub after the government action raised the specter of government action chilling the publication of this code.  \n\nIn keeping with our longstanding defense of the right to publish code, we are representing Professor Matthew Green, who teaches computer science at the Johns Hopkins Information Security Institute, including applied cryptography and anonymous cryptocurrencies. Part of his work involves studying and improving privacy-enhancing technologies, and teaching his students about mixers like Tornado Cash. The disappearance of Tornado Cash’s repository from GitHub created a gap in the available information on mixer technology, so Professor Green made a fork of the code, and posted the replica so it would be available for study. The First Amendment protects both GitHub’s right to host that code, and Professor Green’s right to publish (here republish) it on GitHub so he and others can use it for teaching, for further study, and for development of the technology.",

          "description": "On his blog, Federico Mena Quintero posted a transcript of his recent talk at GUADEC 2022 on the technical debt in the GNOME accessibility infrastructure—and what he has been doing to help pay that down.  He began the talk by describing the infrastructure and how it came about:\n\nGnome-shell implements its own toolkit, St, which stands for \"shell toolkit\". It is made accessible by implementing the GObject interfaces in atk. To make a toolkit accessible means adding a way to extract information from it in a standard way; you don't want screen readers to have separate implementations for GTK, Qt, St, Firefox, etc. For every window, regardless of toolkit, you want to have a \"list children\" method. For every widget you want \"get accessible name\", so for a button it may tell you \"OK button\", and for an image it may tell you \"thumbnail of file.jpg\". For widgets that you can interact with, you want \"list actions\" and \"run action X\", so a button may present an \"activate\" action, and a check button may present a \"toggle\" action.\n\nHowever, ATK is just abstract interfaces for the benefit of toolkits. We need a way to ship the information extracted from toolkits to assistive tech like screen readers. The atspi protocol is a set of DBus interfaces that an application must implement; atk-adaptor is an implementation of those DBus interfaces that works by calling atk's slightly different interfaces, which in turn are implemented by toolkits. Atk-adaptor also caches some things that it already asked to the toolkit, so it doesn't have to ask again unless the toolkit notifies about a change.\n\nDoes this seem like too much translation going on? It is! We will see the reasons behind that when we talk about how accessibility was implemented many years ago in GNOME.",

We've had arm64 hardware\n\taround running Linux for a long time, but none of it has really\n\tbeen usable as a development platform until now.\n\n\nHe also notes that the next kernel is likely to be 6.0.\n\nSignificant features in 5.19 include\nArm Scalable\nMatrix Extension support,\na number of io_uring improvements,\nBIG TCP support,\nnumerous random-number\ngenerator improvements,\nsupport for AMD's Secure\nNested Paging and Intel's Trusted\nDomain Extensions mechanisms,\nsupport for the Loongson \"LoongArch\" CPU architecture,\na new proactive\nreclaim mechanism,\nand more.

          "description": "I generally prefer C, so I’m accustomed to building whatever I need\non the fly, such as heaps, linked lists, and especially hash\ntables. Few programs use more than a small subset of a data structure’s\nfeatures, making their implementation smaller, simpler, and more\nefficient than the general case, which must handle every edge\ncase. A typical hash table tutorial will describe a relatively lengthy\nprogram, but in practice, bespoke hash tables are only a few lines of\ncode. Over the years I’ve worked out some basic principles for hash\ntable construction that aid in quick and efficient implementation. This\narticle covers the technique and philosophy behind what I’ve come to call\nthe “mask-step-index” (MSI) hash table, which is my standard approach.\nMSI hash tables are nothing novel, just a doub…",

          "description": "* 애매성이란 한 단어가 두 개 이상의 의미를 갖고 있는 경우이다. 가령 ‘눈’과 같은 단어가 애매하다. 그것은 우리 얼굴에 있는 눈을 의미하기도 하고, 하늘에서 내리는 눈을 의미하기도 한다. 반면에 모호성이란 그 단어의 기준이 명확하지 않는 경우이다. 가령 ‘대머리’라는 단어는 대머리와 안대머리의 기준이 명백하지 않다. 애매한 단어는 문맥에 따라 분명하게 표현해 주면 된다. 이것이 ‘문맥적 정의’이다. 반면에 모호한 단어는 그 뜻을 규정해 주면 된다. 따라서 ‘규약적 정의’에 의해 모호성을 분명하게 한다. 우리 일상적 단어들은 거의 모호하다. 따라서 어떤 개념이 모호하다고 지적하는 것은 가장 나중에 하는 것이 좋다.......",

I’m working with what will be\nan underwater design, as shown in Fig. 1.\nFig 1. Controlling an Underwater FPGA\n\n\n\nFor those who haven’t figured it out, this will (eventually) form the basis of\na SONAR device.\nAt first, this problem seems simple enough: there will be an FPGA device\ncontrolled via a network port.  Easy, got it.  Better yet, what’s the easiest\nnetwork protocol to use?\nTCP.  Open\nSource TCP,\nsoftware stacks aren’t all that hard to write, and I know there are several\nopen source stacks that are easy enough to use.  (No, I’ve never written one\nmyself …)\nBut, let’s dig a little deeper: I want to be able to control and debug the\nCPU\nvia the same network port.  That means I’ll want to …",
