          "description": "Recently I've been building a fully internationalized (i18n) and localized (l10n) web application for the first time with Go's golang.org/x/text packages. I've found that the packages and tools that live under golang.org/x/text are really effective and well designed, although the documentation currently available is limited in places and it's been a bit of a challenge to figure out how to put it all together in the context of a real application.\nSo in this tutorial, I want to start explaining how you can use the golang.org/x/text packages for i18n and l10n in your code, and in particular, how to work with them in the context of a web application.\nNote: Just in case you're not already aware, the packages that live under golang.org/x are part of the official Go Project but outside the main G…",

Our\n\tsolution, historically, has been to hold cryptography at\n\tthe latest version that did not require Rust to build.  However,\n\tthat version is not compatible with OpenSSL 3, and so it will\n\teventually need to be upgraded to a new version which is.

An SBOM [software bill of materials] accounts for the software components contained in an application — open source, proprietary, or third-party — and details their provenance, license, and security attributes. SBOMs are used as a part of a foundational practice to track and trace components across software supply chains. SBOMs also help to proactively identify software issues and risks and establish a starting point for their remediation.\n\nSPDX results from ten years of collaboration from representatives across industries, including the leading Software Composition Analysis (SCA) vendors – making it the most robust, mature, and adopted SBOM standard.",

Some applications may need to make changes to compile and\n\twork correctly, and many applications will need to be changed to\n\tavoid the deprecations warnings. We have put together a migration \n\tguide to describe the major differences in OpenSSL 3.0 compared to\n\tprevious releases.\n\n\nOpenSSL has also been relicensed to Apache 2.0, which should end the era of\n\"special exceptions\" needed to use OpenSSL in GPL-licensed applications.\nSee this\nblog entry and the changelog for\nmore information.",

          "description": "Once upon a time, block storage devices were slow, to the point that they\noften limited the speed of the system as a whole.  A great deal of effort\nwent into carefully ordering requests to get the best performance out of\nthe storage device; achieving that goal was well worth expending some CPU\ntime.  But then storage devices got much faster and the equation changed.\nFancy I/O-scheduling mechanisms have fallen by the wayside and effort is now\nfocused on optimizing code so that the CPU can keep up with its storage.  A\nblock-layer change that was merged for the 5.15 kernel shows the kinds of\ntradeoffs that must be made to get the best performance from current hardware.",

Typically, for managed languages the bugs are within the umbrella term of uncaught exceptions and denial of service bugs, whereas in native languages the bugs are mostly split between assert violations, NULL-dereferences, heap-out-of-bounds, stack-out-of-bounds, stack overflows, integer arithmetic, memory leaks, out-of-memory and timeout bugs.",

The kernel's user-space binary \ninterface (ABI) was not changed, which is the usual test for a patch to get\nreverted, but the report still led to a reversion.  The change did lead to\nproblems building a user-space application because it moved some header\nfiles to staging/ as part of a cleanup for a deprecated—though\napparently still functioning—driver for a Digital\nVideo Broadcasting (DVB) device.  There are a few different issues\ntangled together here, but the reversion of a regression in the user-space\nAPI (and not ABI) is a new wrinkle.",

          "description": "(이코노미스트) 제2의 일론 머스크가 되려는 사람들이 넘쳐납니다. 과연 누가 넥스트 테슬라가 될 수 있을까요? 최근 전기차 스타트업 붐이 펼쳐지고 있습니다. 중국의 전기차 기업인 아이웨이즈(Aiways), 리오토(Li Auto), 니오(Nio), WM 모터(WM Motor), 샤오펑(Xpeng)은 이미 수천 대의 전기차 양산에 돌입했습니다. 미국의 카누(Canoo), 피스커(Fisker), 로드스타운(Lordstown), 루시드(Lucid), 리비안(Rivian)을 비롯한 미국의 전기차 기업도 곧 대량 생산에 들어갈 것으로 알려졌습니다. 그뿐만 아니라, 폭스바겐, GM, 포드 등 기존 자동차 업계의 강자들도 전기차 시장에 뛰어들고 있습니다. 돌입할 것으로 알려졌습니다. 그리고 테크 업계의 거인인 애플이 자율주행 전기차인 아이카(iCar)를 출시할 것이라는 소식이 파다합니다. 과연 테슬라를 뒤따를 전기차 전쟁의 승자는 누가 될까요? 이코노미스트의 기사를 소개합니다.",
