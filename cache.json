Building from source in a user-verifiable manner is part of the philosophy behind Guix, but there were a number of problems that were encountered:\n\nThe first surprise when starting packaging PyTorch is that, despite being on PyPI, PyTorch is first and foremost a large C++ code base. It does have a setup.py as commonly found in pure Python packages, but that file delegates the bulk of the work to CMake.\n\nThe second surprise is that PyTorch bundles (or \"vendors\", as some would say) source code for no less than 41 dependencies, ranging from small Python and C++ helper libraries to large C++ neural network tools. Like other distributions such as Debian, Guix avoids bundling: we would rather have one Guix package for each of these dependencies. The rationale is manifold, but it boils down to keeping things auditable, reducing resource usage, and making security updates practical.",

An SBOM [software bill of materials] accounts for the software components contained in an application — open source, proprietary, or third-party — and details their provenance, license, and security attributes. SBOMs are used as a part of a foundational practice to track and trace components across software supply chains. SBOMs also help to proactively identify software issues and risks and establish a starting point for their remediation.\n\nSPDX results from ten years of collaboration from representatives across industries, including the leading Software Composition Analysis (SCA) vendors – making it the most robust, mature, and adopted SBOM standard.",

          "description": "Once upon a time, block storage devices were slow, to the point that they\noften limited the speed of the system as a whole.  A great deal of effort\nwent into carefully ordering requests to get the best performance out of\nthe storage device; achieving that goal was well worth expending some CPU\ntime.  But then storage devices got much faster and the equation changed.\nFancy I/O-scheduling mechanisms have fallen by the wayside and effort is now\nfocused on optimizing code so that the CPU can keep up with its storage.  A\nblock-layer change that was merged for the 5.15 kernel shows the kinds of\ntradeoffs that must be made to get the best performance from current hardware.",

Typically, for managed languages the bugs are within the umbrella term of uncaught exceptions and denial of service bugs, whereas in native languages the bugs are mostly split between assert violations, NULL-dereferences, heap-out-of-bounds, stack-out-of-bounds, stack overflows, integer arithmetic, memory leaks, out-of-memory and timeout bugs.",

The idea is to perform initialization\nlike usual, then drop capabilities before handling untrusted input,\nlimiting unwanted side effects. This feature is applicable even where type\nsafety isn’t an issue, such as Python, where a program might still get\ntricked into accessing sensitive files or making network connections when\nit shouldn’t. So how can a Python program access these system calls?\nAs discussed previously, it’s quite easy to access C APIs from\nPython through its ctypes package, and this is no exception.\nIn this article I show how to do it.
