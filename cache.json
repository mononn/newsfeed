          "description": "In this post I'd like to talk about one of my favorite architectural patterns for building web applications and APIs in Go. It's kind of a mix between the service object and fat model patterns — so I mentally refer to it as the 'fat service' pattern, but it might have a more formal name that I'm not aware of 🙃\nIt's certainly not a perfect pattern (we'll discuss some of the pros and cons later) — but it is (deliberately) simple, pragmatic, and I find it often works well for small-to-medium sized projects.\nNote: Before we start I'd like to emphasize that there's no single 'correct' way to structure your project in Go. Different architectures suit different projects and teams, and this is just one option to consider.\n\n\nAt a high-level, the fat service pattern splits your project code into tw…",

Let's consider it from a developer's perspective.\nRun multiple containers on Kubernetes\nRunning a container with Docker or Podman is great, but it's only a start. To implement an entire system, you need several services (or microservices, if you will).

The first article, How to convert a web application to Software-as-a-Service, discussed from a conceptual point of view how to convert a standalone web application into generic code that powers a SaaS platform. This article demonstrates in a concrete manner how to implement a multitenant SaaS in a Kubernetes cluster.\nThe example in the previous article converted a fictitious standalone application named Clyde's Clarinets into a SaaS platform named Instrument Resellers. The purpose of Clyde's Clarinets was to acquire, refurbish, and resell used clarinets. Clyde's Clarinets evolved into the Instrument Resellers SaaS platform so that any business could acquire, refurbish, and resell a part…",

          "description": "The Electronic Frontier Foundation has announced that it is representing cryptography professor Matthew Green, who has chosen to republish the sanctioned Tornado Cash open-source code as a GitHub repository. \n\nEFF’s most central concern about OFAC’s [US Office of Foreign Assets Control] actions arose because, after the SDN [Specially Designated Nationals] listing of “Tornado Cash,” GitHub took down the canonical repository of the Tornado Cash source code, along with the accounts of the primary developers, including all their code contributions. While GitHub has its own right to decide what goes on its platform, the disappearance of this source code from GitHub after the government action raised the specter of government action chilling the publication of this code.  \n\nIn keeping with our longstanding defense of the right to publish code, we are representing Professor Matthew Green, who teaches computer science at the Johns Hopkins Information Security Institute, including applied cryptography and anonymous cryptocurrencies. Part of his work involves studying and improving privacy-enhancing technologies, and teaching his students about mixers like Tornado Cash. The disappearance of Tornado Cash’s repository from GitHub created a gap in the available information on mixer technology, so Professor Green made a fork of the code, and posted the replica so it would be available for study. The First Amendment protects both GitHub’s right to host that code, and Professor Green’s right to publish (here republish) it on GitHub so he and others can use it for teaching, for further study, and for development of the technology.",

          "description": "On his blog, Federico Mena Quintero posted a transcript of his recent talk at GUADEC 2022 on the technical debt in the GNOME accessibility infrastructure—and what he has been doing to help pay that down.  He began the talk by describing the infrastructure and how it came about:\n\nGnome-shell implements its own toolkit, St, which stands for \"shell toolkit\". It is made accessible by implementing the GObject interfaces in atk. To make a toolkit accessible means adding a way to extract information from it in a standard way; you don't want screen readers to have separate implementations for GTK, Qt, St, Firefox, etc. For every window, regardless of toolkit, you want to have a \"list children\" method. For every widget you want \"get accessible name\", so for a button it may tell you \"OK button\", and for an image it may tell you \"thumbnail of file.jpg\". For widgets that you can interact with, you want \"list actions\" and \"run action X\", so a button may present an \"activate\" action, and a check button may present a \"toggle\" action.\n\nHowever, ATK is just abstract interfaces for the benefit of toolkits. We need a way to ship the information extracted from toolkits to assistive tech like screen readers. The atspi protocol is a set of DBus interfaces that an application must implement; atk-adaptor is an implementation of those DBus interfaces that works by calling atk's slightly different interfaces, which in turn are implemented by toolkits. Atk-adaptor also caches some things that it already asked to the toolkit, so it doesn't have to ask again unless the toolkit notifies about a change.\n\nDoes this seem like too much translation going on? It is! We will see the reasons behind that when we talk about how accessibility was implemented many years ago in GNOME.",

I’m working with what will be\nan underwater design, as shown in Fig. 1.\nFig 1. Controlling an Underwater FPGA\n\n\n\nFor those who haven’t figured it out, this will (eventually) form the basis of\na SONAR device.\nAt first, this problem seems simple enough: there will be an FPGA device\ncontrolled via a network port.  Easy, got it.  Better yet, what’s the easiest\nnetwork protocol to use?\nTCP.  Open\nSource TCP,\nsoftware stacks aren’t all that hard to write, and I know there are several\nopen source stacks that are easy enough to use.  (No, I’ve never written one\nmyself …)\nBut, let’s dig a little deeper: I want to be able to control and debug the\nCPU\nvia the same network port.  That means I’ll want to …",
