Many of the group’sprocesses were still not well-defined enough for the group to operate well.Over the course of 2021, the key processes were defined well enough to enablethe group to operate reasonably well:\n\nWe defined details on how to report security issues, see this commit on20th of May 2021.\nWe refined the nomination process for new group members, see thiscommit on 30th of July2021.\nWe wrote a first annual transparency report, which is published athttps://llvm.org/docs/SecurityTransparencyReports.htmlThere is a copy of the 2021 transparency report below.\n\nOver the course of 2021, we had 2 people leave the LLVM Security group and 4people join.\nIn 2021, the security group received 13 issue reports that were made publiclyvisible before 31st of December 2021. The security group judged 2 of thesereports to be security issues:\n\nhttps://bugs.chromium.org/p/llvm/issues/detail?id=5\nhttps://bugs.chromium.org/p/llvm/issues/detail?id=11\n\nBoth issues were addressed with source changes: #5 in clangd/vscode-clangd, and#11 in llvm-project. No dedicated LLVM release was made for either.\nWe believe that with the publishing of the first annual transparency report,the security group now has implemented all necessary processes for the group tooperate as promised. The group’s processes can be improved further, and we doexpect further improvements to get implemented in 2022. Many of the potentialimprovements end up being discussed on the monthly public call on LLVM’ssecurity group.",

Advertisers can learn from the output to ensure their ads are compliant with Google Ads Policies at all times. \nBusiness Challenge:\nAdvertisers operating at scale need a solution to holistically review policy violating ads across their accounts so they can ensure compliance with Google’s Ad Policies. As Google introduces more policies and enforcement mechanisms, advertisers need to continue checking their accounts to ensure they comply with Google’s Ads Policies.\nSolution Overview:  \n“Disapproved Ads Auditor” is a tool  that enables advertisers to review at scale all disapproved ads across their  Google Ads accounts. This view  allows advertisers to proactively audit their accounts , analyze the ad disapprovals holistically and identify  learnings to minimize and  reduce submission of potentially policy violating ads. \nThe tool is based on a Python script, which can be run in either of the following modes: \n \n“Audit Mode”- export an output of disapproved ads across your accounts \n“Remove Mode” - delete currently disapproved ads and log details.\n \nThere are a few output files (see here) which are saved locally under the “output” folder and there is an optional feature to export on BigQuery for further data analysis (“Disapproved Ads Auditor” dataset). \nSkills Required:   \n \n Python 3.9+ \n BigQuery API \n Google Ads API \n OAuth 2.0\n \nGoogle Products Used:\n \nGoogle Ads  \nBigQuery\n \nEstimated time to implement the solution: ~2h \nImplementation instructions: View on github\nImpact:\n“Disapproved Ads Auditor” tool automates auditing ads across your accounts to provide you insights into non compliant ads. You can take the learnings from the output to ensure ads are compliant with Google Ads Policies and avoid creating non compliant ads. Moreover, you can optionally remove disapproved ads.",

There were, of course, other things going on around that\ntime, holidays, vacations, and so forth, so the discussion was relatively\nmuted until recently.  Proponents have a number of reasons why they would like\nto see the move, but there is resistance, as well, that is due, at least in part, to the\nlongstanding \"tradition\" of the location for the database.",
