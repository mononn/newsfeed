          "description": "When searching for examples of HTTP basic authentication with Go, every result I could find unfortunately contained code which is either out-of-date (i.e. doesn't use the r.BasicAuth() functionality that was introduced in Go 1.4) or is vulnerable to timing attacks.\nSo in this post I'd like to quickly discuss how to implement basic authentication correctly in your Go applications.\nWe'll start with a bit of background information, but if you're not interested in that you can skip straight to the code.\nWhat is basic authentication? When should I use it?\nAs a developer, you're probably already familiar with the prompt that web browsers show when you visit a URL that's protected by basic authentication.\n\nWhen you input a username and password into this prompt, the web browser will send a HTTP r…",

          "description": "One of my favorite things about the recent Go 1.16 release is a small — but very welcome — addition to the flag package: the flag.Func() function. This makes it much easier to define and use custom command-line flags in your application.\nFor example, if you want to parse a flag like --pause=10s directly into a time.Duration type,  or parse --urls=\"http://example.com http://example.org\" directly into a []string slice, then previously you had two options. You could either create a custom type to implement the flag.Value interface, or use a third-party package like pflag.\nBut now the flag.Func() function gives you a simple and lightweight alternative. In this short post we're going to take a look at a few examples of how you can use it in your own code.\nParsing custom flag types\nTo demonstrat…",

          "description": "Recently I wrote a cute little program for doing Turtle Graphics.  For those of you who don't know, turtle graphics were originally added to the LOGO language by Seymour Papert in the late 1960s.  He built a robot that he called a \"turtle\" that could hold a pen.  The robot had wheels and could move forwards and backwards, and could rotate left and right.  It could also raise and lower the pen.  When placed on a sheet of paper, the turtle could be commanded to draw interesting designs.\nPapert's goal was to teach children about programming.  As the years went by the robot got replaced with screens, and the turtle became an icon that could draw lines.  Children from the 70s until now have been enthralled by the simple commands for directing the turtle, and the elegant drawings they can make.\n…",

The name of the program was: Mr Patternson's Computerized Gate, and it was implemented on a little plastic computer named DIGICOMP-I, which was a cute little three bit finite state machine with 6 AND gates.\nThe first electronic computer I ever wrote a program for was an ECP-18 in 1966.  This was a 15 bit wide machine with 1024 words of drum memory.  The programs I wrote were all in binary machine language and were entered through the front-panel switches.\nIn the years between 1967 and 1969 my father would drive my friend, Tim Conrad, and I 25 miles to the Digital Equipment Corp sales office, where we would spend our Saturdays entering programs into the PDP-8 that they had on the floor.

          "description": "Posted by Ashley Francisco\n \n The Google for Startups Accelerator: Women Founders program is now open for applications until July 19.\nLast year, we launched the inaugural Google for Startups Accelerator: Women Founders program in North America to help women-led startups identify and solve technical challenges while scaling their companies. The inaugural cohort also received tailored programming to address some of the longstanding barriers that women founders face.  \nWomen founders remain underrepresented in the tech startup ecosystem because they often lack access to the resources needed to start, build, and grow their businesses. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated these structural barriers by disproportionately impacting women in the workforce—and research shows women were more vulnerable to the economic effects of COVID-19 because of existing gender disparities.    \nFor women founders, access to capital is one of the major challenges to launching their business.  A recent report showed women-led startups received a mere 2.3% of global venture capitalist funding in 2020, falling from 2.8% the year before.  \nThe Google for Startups Accelerator: Women Founders program aims to help bridge the gap and create opportunities for women founders to succeed.  Beyond mentorship and technical project support, the accelerator also includes deep dives and workshops focused on product design, customer acquisition, and leadership development for founders. Participants will also hear from a roster of speakers and facilitators who deliver both technical and nontechnical programming for women-led startups.  \nApplications for the second Google for Startups Accelerator: Women Founders program are now open until July 19, for North American applicants. Approximately 10-12 startups with at least one woman founder will be selected from across North America. The accelerator runs from September through to December 2021.  \nTo learn more about the program and to apply, visit the website.",

To the best of my knowledge, this is the first public writeup of a KVM guest-to-host breakout that does not rely on bugs in user space components such as QEMU. The discussed bug was assigned CVE-2021-29657, affects kernel versions v5.10-rc1 to v5.12-rc6 and was patched at the end of March 2021. As the bug only became exploitable in v5.10 and was discovered roughly 5 months later, most real world deployments of KVM should not be affected. I still think the issue is an interesting case study in the work required to build a stable guest-to-host escape against KVM and hope that this writeup can strengthen the case that hypervisor compromises are not only theoretical issues.",

Developers from the KernelCI team,\nGoogle, and Collabora worked to improve many different aspects of KernelCI\ntesting capabilities.  There are plans for more hackfests.\n\nThe first-ever KernelCI hackfest was a success. It kicked off the work to enable kernel testing through Chromium OS, a product-specific userspace. Enabling full userspace images and real-world tests like video call simulations adds a lot of complexity to the testing process. However, the benefits are a clear win for the community. They allow a more thorough kernel testing and validation through real application use cases, which can exercise several different kernel areas at the same time in an organized manner. Generally, it is not simple for lower-level kernel test suites like kselftests or LTP to orchestrate a similar use case.",

As such, vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel\ncan have a wide-ranging impact, putting security and privacy for people,\norganizations, and devices at risk. Since it’s written largely in the C\nlanguage, which is not memory-safe, memory safety vulnerabilities such as\nbuffer overflows and use-after-frees are a constant concern. By making it\npossible to write parts of the Linux kernel in Rust, which is memory-safe,\nwe can entirely eliminate memory safety vulnerabilities from certain\ncomponents, such as drivers.\n\n\nWe have previously covered another\nProssimo project, which provides funding for\nRustls development, as well as Ojeda's work\non Rust in the kernel.",
