          "description": "eBPF is a low-level technology for running sandboxed kernel programs. Its use in Kubernetes-based applications has grown rapidly due to the revolutionary capabilities it enables, as demonstrated by Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) projects such as Cilium, Datadog, Calico, and Pixie. However, eBPF in Kubernetes also poses a number of new challenges for developers and administrators alike. These challenges include program lifecycle management issues, the widespread use of privileged pods, the lack of eBPF subsystem visibility, and problems with program cooperation.\nbpfman is an open source project dedicated to making eBPF easier to secure, manage, and use. The project includes an operator that allows eBPF application developers to package programs via OCI container images and deploy …",

Today, it hosts millions of images for hundreds of thousands of critical customer workloads, including Red Hat’s own product catalog.\nOne of the marquee features of Quay.io is free security scanning for any image that we host. This happens automatically as soon as you push an image to Quay.io. Not only does it scan your image at upload time, it also provides an up-to-date view of your vulnerabilities, no matter how long ago you pushed it. There is no need to ask Quay.io to rescan your image—that information is available whenever you request it. \nThis is critical, as container images typically only gather more and more vulnerabilities as they age.

This absence impacts how Fedora packages are built on s390x, either by prohibiting packages that require LLD or by requiring that the s390x package is linked with a different linker than other architectures.

Fedora Magazine has a\npost by Timothée Ravier about the problem, how users can work\naround it, and what the project is doing to avoid the similar problems\nin the future:\nOn Fedora Atomic Desktops and Fedora IoT systems, the components\nthat are part of the boot chain (Shim, GRUB) are not (yet)\nautomatically updated alongside the rest of the system. Thus, if you\nhave installed a Fedora Atomic Desktop or a Fedora IoT system before\nFedora 40, it uses an old versions of the Shim and bootloader binaries\nto boot your system.\nWhen Secure Boot is enabled, the EFI firmware loads Shim\nfirst. Shim is signed by the Microsoft Third Party Certificate\nAuthority so that it can be verified on most hardware out of the\nbox. The Shim binary includes the Fedora certificates used to verify\nbinaries signed by Fedora. Then Shim loads GRUB, which in turn loads\nthe Linux kernel. Both are signed by Fedora.\nUntil recently, the kernel binaries where signed two times, with an\nolder key and a newer one. With the 6.9 kernel update, the kernel is\nno longer signed with the old key. If GRUB or Shim is old enough and\ndoes not know about the new key, the signature verification fails.",

          "description": "Changwoo Min has posted an\nintroduction to writing custom schedulers with sched_ext.\n\n\n\tIn a particular situation, when each scheduling policy needs its\n\tspecific action, the core kernel scheduler calls an operation\n\tdefined in struct sched_class. For example, when the core\n\tkernel scheduler needs to select a task to be scheduled, it calls\n\tthe sched_class.pick_next_task(rq) callback of a concrete\n\tscheduling policy. When a task becomes runnable, the core kernel\n\tscheduler calls sched_class.enqueue(rq, p, flags) so the\n\tconcrete scheduling policy enqueues task p to run queue\n\trq. When a task's runtime state needs to be updated, the\n\tcore kernel scheduler calls sched_class.update_curr(rq).",

Worse yet: much of it was due to neglect of secure coding practices, existing security mechanisms were disabled for no good reason. I didn’t finish that investigation because I discovered that the browser was essentially spyware, collecting your browsing history and selling it via Avast’s Jumpshot subsidiary.\nBut that was almost five years ago. After an initial phase of denial, Avast decided to apologize and to wind down Jumpshot. It was certainly a mere coincidence that Avast was subsequently sold to NortonLifeLock, called Gen Digital today. Yes, Avast is truly reformed and paying for their crimes in Europe …",
