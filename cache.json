          "description": "In this post we're going to walk through how to use GitHub Actions to create a continuous integration (CI) pipeline that automatically tests, vets and lints your Go code.\nFor solo projects I usually create a pre-commit Git hook to carry out these kinds of checks, but for team projects or open-source work — where you don't have control over everyone's development environment — using a CI workflow is a great way to flag up potential problems and help catch bugs before they make it into production or a versioned release.\nAnd if you're already using GitHub to host your repository, it's nice and easy to use their built-in functionality to do this without any need for additional third-party tools or services.\nTo demonstrate how it works, let's run through a step-by-step example.\nIf you'd like to…",

To illustrate, we'll look at how to change this URL:\n\n\n\nTo this:\n\n\n\nIf you want to change the URL query string in place:\n\n  \n\nRunning this will print out:\n\n\n\nIf you want to create a clone of the URL but with a different query string, while leaving the original URL unchanged, you need to create a copy of the original url.URL struct first. \nThere are a couple of ways to do this. You can either re-parse the URL, or you can dereference the original url.URL and make a copy, like so:\n\n\n\nWhen you do this, you create a new newURL variable of type url.URL which is initialized to the (dereferenced) value of *originalURL. This means that newURL has a different address in memory to originalURL.\nPutting this together, the pattern for creating a new URL with different parameters is:\n\n\n\nRunning this will print out:\n\n\n\nAs a side note, you can use this technique any time you want to 'clone' a URL and make changes to it.

It allows them to reach hundreds of millions     of people looking to buy products like yours each day. \n\n    To upload their products, merchants can make use of feeds, that is, files     with a list of products in a specific format. These can be shared with     Merchant Center in different ways: using Google Sheets, SFTP or FTP shares,     Google Cloud Storage or manually through the user interface. These methods     work great for the majority of cases. But, if a merchant's product list     grows over time, they might reach the usage limits of the feeds.

Incorrect use of virtual functions is a classic mistake. Developers often use virtual functions incorrectly. In this article, we discuss this classic mistake. I suppose the reader is familiar with virtual functions in C++. Let's get straight to the point. When we call a virtual function in a constructor, the function is overridden only within a base class or a currently created class. Constructors in the derived classes have not yet been called. Therefore, the virtual functions implemented in them will not be called. Let me illustrate this.",

TheXTech accurately reproduces the original game's behavior. It also includes optional bug fixes. It runs not only on Windows, but also on macOS, and Linux systems with x86, ARM or PowerPC processors. Some developers also ported it on 3DS and PS Vista The TheXTech developer — Vitaliy Novichkov (Wohlstand) — described the development process in detail on Habr. He also described the techniques he used to smooth out the differences when porting the project from VB6 to C++.

Before a package is formally introduced to CentOS Stream, it undergoes a battery of tests and checks—both automated and manual—to ensure it meets the stringent standards for inclusion in RHEL. Updates posted to Stream are identical to those posted to the unreleased minor version of RHEL. The aim? For CentOS Stream to be as fundamentally stable as RHEL itself.\n\nTo achieve this stability, each major release of Stream starts from a stable release of Fedora Linux—In CentOS Stream 9, this begins with Fedora 34, which is the same code base from which RHEL 9 is built. As updated packages pass testing and meet standards for stability, they are pushed into CentOS Stream as well as the nightly build of RHEL.",

The vulnerability is a bog-standard buffer overflow that has existed in the library since 2012 despite various kinds of static analysis, testing, and fuzzing that Mozilla and others have applied to it over the years.  He found it with a new fuzzing technique:\n\nTo solve this problem, I’ve been experimenting with monitoring the call stack during execution.\n\nThe naive implementation is too slow to be practical, but after a lot of optimization I had come up with a library that was fast enough to be integrated into coverage-guided fuzzing, and was testing how it performed with NSS and other libraries.\n\n[...] The fuzzer I was using is able to isolate and extract interesting new ASN.1 OIDs, SEQUENCEs, INTEGERs, and so on. Once extracted, it can then randomly combine or insert them into template data. This isn’t really a new idea, but is a new implementation. I'm planning to open source this code in the future.",

ClusterFuzzLite is a descendant of OSS-Fuzz, which we looked at in 2017.\n\nLarge projects including systemd and curl are already using ClusterFuzzLite during code review, with positive results. According to Daniel Stenberg, author of curl, “When the human reviewers nod and have approved the code and your static code analyzers and linters can't detect any more issues, fuzzing is what takes you to the next level of code maturity and robustness. OSS-Fuzz and ClusterFuzzLite help us maintain curl as a quality project, around the clock, every day and every commit.”\n\n[...] To learn more, check out the ClusterFuzzLite documentation. ClusterFuzzLite currently supports GitHub Actions, Google Cloud Build and Prow. We built this with CI system extensibility in mind, and adding support for other CI systems is straightforward. Please contact us if you’re interested in contributing support, or have any questions, feedback or feature requests.",

The post covers a number of different topics, including the consolidation of web sites at go.dev, releases and their features over the last year, as well as a look to the future:\n\nIn February, the Go 1.18 release will expand the new register-based calling convention to non-x86 architectures, bringing dramatic performance improvements with it. It will include the new Go fuzzing support. And it will be the first release to include support for generics.\n\nGenerics will be one of our focuses for 2022. The initial release in Go 1.18 is only the beginning. We need to spend time using generics and learning what works and what doesn’t, so that we can write best practices and decide what should be added to the standard library and other libraries. We expect that Go 1.19 (expected in August 2022) and later releases will further refine the design and implementation of generics as well as integrating them further into the overall Go experience.",

These are: the current sensible default, the one we're\n\texperimenting with as a trial, and the one that we hate and want to retire.\nThe conversation goes like this: We want to introduce a new messaging\n  technology. How many do we have already in place? Oh we have three in active\n  use, including one that's considered legacy and we're partway through\n  migrating off and one that we experimented with previously but didn't gain\n  traction. Ok, so we're at our limit now. If we want to add another messaging\n  tech then we have two choices. Either migrate all of our apps off the legacy\n  tech, or properly rid ourselves of the failed experiment. This is quite\n  closely related to the idea of capping the number of Innovation Tokens in\n  use within your teams.\nAt a team level these kinds of limits are relatively easy\n  to maintain and discuss and act upon, because we have common priorities and\n  ways of working and high trust, high bandwidth communication. At the scope of\n  the whole organisation the challenge is similar, but getting alignment takes a\n  lot longer and doing actual migration and consolidation work can take a long\n  time - so we sometimes have to allow for more variation in technology. We also use \n  different techniques to discuss and communicate the status of our preferred technologies.\nAn approach we use at MYOB to engage our whole organisation in broader decisions about\n  technology is by publishing our own MYOB Technology Radar, following the\n  format of the Thoughtworks Technology Radar.\n  This approach of building our own radar\n  involves taking input from all of our verticals and teams, and making a clear\n  statement on what technologies we encourage teams to adopt, trial, or more\n  importantly which ones to keep clear of.",

However, there’s a better approach that is\nnot only simpler, but around 3x faster on modern hardware. Even more,\nthere’s yet another approach using SIMD intrinsics, plus some bit\ntwiddling tricks, which increases the processing speed by an order of\nmagnitude.
