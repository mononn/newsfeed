The first fix resulted in the ovs-vswitchd sending an array of a size that the Open vSwitch kernel module will accept and not trigger the CPU mismatch error message.

For more information on source containers, see this Red Hat Customer Portal article.\nThis release also includes the most recent Critical Patch Update (CPU) versions of OpenJDK 8, 11, and 17 (8u372, 11.0.19, and 17.0.7, respectively), which we independently shipped in April.\nMaximum heap size\nLast time we blogged about plans to change the default value for the configuration option JAVA_MAX_MEM_RATIO in the June update of the Universal Base Image (UBI) 8 images.\nThis option corresponds to the JVM argument -XX:MaxRAMPercentage, and we planned to change the default from 50.0 to 80.0 (80% of detected RAM) (OPENJDK-559), aligning the default with the UBI9 images.\nUnfortunately, this change didn't make the cut for the June update, and the default value remains 50%. We are now targeting the August update for this change.\nCustomers who want to preview the new value can set it explicitly: JAVA_MAX_MEM_RATIO=80.0.\nWhat's next\nThe next OpenJDK CPU is scheduled for July 18, 2023. We'll ship updated containers shortly afterward. As usual, those container updates will be solely for the updated OpenJDK and will not contain changes to the container scripts themselves. Our next container feature update is planned for August.\nWe do all our planning in the open on the Red Hat Issue Tracker. If there's something you'd like to see, get in touch, either by leaving a comment or (for an image change) filing an issue.\nWhat's new in the Red Hat UBI OpenJDK containers appeared first on Red Hat Developer.",

The networking stack is wide and reasons to refuse a given packet are multiple and include invalid data from a protocol, firewall rules, wrong checksum, full queues, qdisc or XDP actions, and many more reasons. It is possible to look at indicators such as MIB counters and statistic counters, but often those are generic and triggered for different reasons, but most importantly their coverage is small, and it's impossible to match a specific packet to a given counter increase. \nSocket buffer drop reasons\nThe socket buffer, SKB (struct sk_buff) is the main data structure representing a packet in the Linux kernel networking stack.

Cyber security, the societal impact of AI, data and privacy are important issues for legislators globally. At the same time, the COVID-19 pandemic drove collaborative development to unprecedented levels and took Open Source software, open research, open content and data from mainstream to main stage. Moving forward, developing these important public policies whilst not harming the ecosystem requires an understanding of how the Open Source ecosystem works. Ensuring stakeholders without historic benefit of representation are included in those discussions becomes paramount to that end.\n\nThe OPA will focus on educating public policy makers on Open Source to inform their development and deliberation of new policy concepts. There are unintended consequences that come from a lack of understanding of how open collaboration works in practice. The OPA will address this as well as the historic absence of contribution from underrepresented groups. The interest areas of the OPA community will complement those of Digitable Public Goods Alliance, a UNICEF multi-stakeholder initiative with a mission to accelerate the attainment of sustainable development goals in low- and middle-income countries that OSI joined earlier this year.",

          "description": "Ruihan Li has disclosed\na significant vulnerability introduced into the 6.1 kernel:\n\n\n\tA flaw was found in the handling of stack expansion in the Linux\n\tkernel 6.1 through 6.4, aka \"Stack Rot\". The maple tree,\n\tresponsible for managing virtual memory areas, can undergo node\n\treplacement without properly acquiring the MM write lock, leading\n\tto use-after-free issues. An unprivileged local user could use this\n\tflaw to compromise the kernel and escalate their privileges.\n\n\tAs StackRot is a Linux kernel vulnerability found in the memory\n\tmanagement subsystem, it affects almost all kernel configurations\n\tand requires minimal capabilities to trigger. However, it should be\n\tnoted that maple nodes are freed using RCU callbacks, delaying the\n\tactual memory deallocation until after the RCU grace\n\tperiod. Consequently, exploiting this vulnerability is considered\n\tchallenging.\n\n\nThe disclosure contains a detailed description of the problem.  Fixes have\nbeen merged into the\nmainline and the 6.4.1, 6.3.11, and 6.1.37\nstable kernel updates.",

That brings me to CentOS Stream, of which there\n\tis immense confusion. I acknowledge that this is a change in a\n\tlongstanding tradition where we went above and beyond, and change\n\tlike this can cause some confusion.

There is CentOS Stream the binary deliverable, and\n\tCentOS Stream the source repository. The CentOS Stream\n\tgitlab source is where we build RHEL releases, in the open for\n\tall to see. To call RHEL “closed source” is categorically untrue\n\tand inaccurate. CentOS Stream moves faster than RHEL, so it might\n\tnot be on HEAD, but the code is there.

          "description": "This post is the second post regarding my new SDIO/eMMC\ncontroller.  The SDIO protocol is commonly\nused on SD cards, and the eMMC protocol for eMMC chips.  The two protocols\nare so similar that, when using\nthis controller, they will differ in\nsoftware only.  Today’s bottom line is that, although the\ncontroller is still quite new and only\nbarely silicon proven, this week I had the chance to formally verify the\nreceive portion\nof the controller and so I thought I might write about what took place.\nMy goal will be to answer the question of whether this extra step of doing\nformal verification was worth it or not.\nThis SDIO controller is being written as\npart of the Klusterlab project.  I’ve been\ncalling this same project the ETH10G\nproject, because at its core it is a 10Gb\nEthernet switch.\nThe…",

The board has been fondly named\nthe “KlusterLab”, because of all of the various interfaces present on it.\nAmong those interfaces are an SD port and an eMMC port.\nNow, how shall I verify their functionality?\nBuilding an SDIO/eMMC Controller\nMy first round of testing the SD port used my SPI-based SD card controller,\nSDSPI.  Using that controller, the card\nresponded in much the way I expected, save that the first sector of the card\nwasn’t what FATFS was expecting.\nSince this is simply board bringup, where we are just trying to verify that the\nhardware is working, I signed the component off as working.  I could obviously\nwrite to the device, and I could read from the device.  (Okay, I…",
