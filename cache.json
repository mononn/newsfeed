However, eBPF in Kubernetes also poses a number of new challenges for developers and administrators alike. These challenges include program lifecycle management issues, the widespread use of privileged pods, the lack of eBPF subsystem visibility, and problems with program cooperation.\nbpfman is an open source project dedicated to making eBPF easier to secure, manage, and use.

I went off to the trusty Linux\nterminal and installed Chrome that way instead\".\nTwo and a half years ago, I committed to doing more open-source\ncontributions in my free time and was finally irritated enough about\nthis problem to look into it. I searched around for more info. Lo and\nbehold, lots\nof people\nwere also\naffected and there was already an\nissue from 2019 on Ubuntu's bug tracker about it.\n[...] As is commonly the case in software development, the difficult part of\nthis fix had nothing to do with the code itself. All of my effort was\nspent figuring out Ubuntu's patch submission processes and advocating\nfor my merge request. Nobody else seemed to be interested in doing the\nwork to actually fix this bug that has been plaguing Ubuntu MATE and\nXubuntu, not to mention some Debian users, for over 6 years. After\ndealing with the long process of getting my merge request approved, I\nthink I'm starting to understand why!\n\n\nBrown notes that the fix is\nnow packaged for the upcoming Ubuntu 24.10 release, and should be\nbackported to 22.04 and 24.04 eventually.",

Fedora Magazine has a\npost by Timothée Ravier about the problem, how users can work\naround it, and what the project is doing to avoid the similar problems\nin the future:\nOn Fedora Atomic Desktops and Fedora IoT systems, the components\nthat are part of the boot chain (Shim, GRUB) are not (yet)\nautomatically updated alongside the rest of the system. Thus, if you\nhave installed a Fedora Atomic Desktop or a Fedora IoT system before\nFedora 40, it uses an old versions of the Shim and bootloader binaries\nto boot your system.\nWhen Secure Boot is enabled, the EFI firmware loads Shim\nfirst. Shim is signed by the Microsoft Third Party Certificate\nAuthority so that it can be verified on most hardware out of the\nbox. The Shim binary includes the Fedora certificates used to verify\nbinaries signed by Fedora. Then Shim loads GRUB, which in turn loads\nthe Linux kernel. Both are signed by Fedora.\nUntil recently, the kernel binaries where signed two times, with an\nolder key and a newer one. With the 6.9 kernel update, the kernel is\nno longer signed with the old key. If GRUB or Shim is old enough and\ndoes not know about the new key, the signature verification fails.",

The Free & Open Source stack supports all of these advances at the lower level, but application UI support has been slower to arrive.

I didn’t finish that investigation because I discovered that the browser was essentially spyware, collecting your browsing history and selling it via Avast’s Jumpshot subsidiary.\nBut that was almost five years ago.
