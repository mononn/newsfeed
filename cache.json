Advertisers can learn from the output to ensure their ads are compliant with Google Ads Policies at all times. \nBusiness Challenge:\nAdvertisers operating at scale need a solution to holistically review policy violating ads across their accounts so they can ensure compliance with Google’s Ad Policies. As Google introduces more policies and enforcement mechanisms, advertisers need to continue checking their accounts to ensure they comply with Google’s Ads Policies.\nSolution Overview:  \n“Disapproved Ads Auditor” is a tool  that enables advertisers to review at scale all disapproved ads across their  Google Ads accounts. This view  allows advertisers to proactively audit their accounts , analyze the ad disapprovals holistically and identify  learnings to minimize and  reduce submission of potentially policy violating ads. \nThe tool is based on a Python script, which can be run in either of the following modes: \n \n“Audit Mode”- export an output of disapproved ads across your accounts \n“Remove Mode” - delete currently disapproved ads and log details.\n \nThere are a few output files (see here) which are saved locally under the “output” folder and there is an optional feature to export on BigQuery for further data analysis (“Disapproved Ads Auditor” dataset). \nSkills Required:   \n \n Python 3.9+ \n BigQuery API \n Google Ads API \n OAuth 2.0\n \nGoogle Products Used:\n \nGoogle Ads  \nBigQuery\n \nEstimated time to implement the solution: ~2h \nImplementation instructions: View on github\nImpact:\n“Disapproved Ads Auditor” tool automates auditing ads across your accounts to provide you insights into non compliant ads. You can take the learnings from the output to ensure ads are compliant with Google Ads Policies and avoid creating non compliant ads. Moreover, you can optionally remove disapproved ads.",

Marek implemented the guts of the\n\twarning, but when I tried it out on the examples provided by the\n\tTrojan Source researchers, I found I had trouble understanding the\n\tinitial results—precisely because of the obfuscation itself.\n\t\n\tSo for GCC 12, I've added a new flag to GCC diagnostics, indicating\n\tthat the diagnostic itself relates to source code encoding. When\n\tany such diagnostic is printed, GCC will now escape non-ASCII\n\tcharacters in the source code.",

Now we have reached a point where we can benefit from a\n  continuous revenue stream to maintain and extend the software without\n  asking for donations or grants.  This is quite a new experience to us\n  and I am actually a bit proud to lead one of the few self-sustaining\n  free software projects who had not to sacrifice the goals of the\n  movement.\n\n\nHe concludes with a request for individuals who have been donating to GnuPG\nto redirect their generosity toward another deserving project.  This is\ngood news; GnuPG ran on a shoestring for far too long.",
