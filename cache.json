With our app, a user can instantly mirror grips from their sound hand onto a robotic one, which could be 3D-printed and self-assembled at low cost. With Mirru, we want to provide a cheap, intuitive and open end-to-end alternative to existing, costly, cumbersome and proprietary technology. \n \n\nFigure 1: A demonstration of using MediaPipe hand tracking to move a robotic hand’s fingers with the Mirru app.\n   \nThe Mirru team is a collaboration between Violeta López and Vladimir Hermand, two independent designers and technologists currently based in Paris.

Prossimo is a new name for the memory-safety\nprojects being run by the Internet Security Research\nGroup (ISRG), which is the organization behind the Let's Encrypt certificate authority\n(CA) project.  Google provided the funds to enable Ojeda to work full-time\non the project starting back in April.\n\n\nThe Linux kernel is at the heart of the modern Internet, from\nservers to client devices. It’s on the front line for processing network\ndata and other forms of input. As such, vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel\ncan have a wide-ranging impact, putting security and privacy for people,\norganizations, and devices at risk. Since it’s written largely in the C\nlanguage, which is not memory-safe, memory safety vulnerabilities such as\nbuffer overflows and use-after-frees are a constant concern. By making it\npossible to write parts of the Linux kernel in Rust, which is memory-safe,\nwe can entirely eliminate memory safety vulnerabilities from certain\ncomponents, such as drivers.\n\n\nWe have previously covered another\nProssimo project, which provides funding for\nRustls development, as well as Ojeda's work\non Rust in the kernel.",

While that mechanism had obvious applications for adding\ntype information to Python functions, standardized interpretations for the\nannotations came later with type hints.\nBut evaluating the annotations at function-definition time caused some\ndifficulties, especially with respect to forward references to type names,\nso a Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) was created to postpone their\nevaluation until they were needed. The PEP-described behavior was set to\nbecome the default in the upcoming Python 3.10 release, but that is\nnot to be; the postponement of evaluation by default has itself been postponed in the\nhopes of unwinding things.",

The most common example is NUMA\narchitectures, where memory attached to the local node is faster to access\nthan memory on other nodes.  Recently, persistent memory has\nstarted appearing in deployed systems as well; this type of memory is\nbyte-addressable like DRAM, but it is available in larger sizes and is slower to\naccess, especially for \nwrites. This new memory type makes memory allocation even more complicated\nfor the kernel, driving the need for a method to better manage multiple types of\nmemory in one system.",

There are lots of interesting topics discussed at the summit, including a talk on making CPython faster from Python creator Guido van Rossum. \"Seven months ago, Guido van Rossum left a brief retirement to work at Microsoft. He was given the freedom to pick a project and decided to work on making CPython faster. Microsoft will be funding a small team consisting of Guido van Rossum, Mark Shannon, Eric Snow, and possibly others. [...] The team is optimistic about doubling CPython's speed for 3.11. They plan to try an adaptive, specializing byte code interpreter, which is a bit like the existing inline cache and a bit like the shadow byte code covered in Dino Viehland's talk.\"  Some of the ideas go back to Shannon's thoughts on speeding up the interpreter that we looked at back in December.",
