a number of revisions and a lot of time to make it into a mainline

Mickaël Salaün, seems like an extreme case; this code was merged for 5.13 after
more than five years of development and 34 versions of the patch set.
This sandboxing mechanism has evolved considerably since LWN covered version 3 of the patch set in

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Prossimo project has announced
that it has contracted with Miguel Ojeda to work on Rust in the Linux kernel
for the next year.  Prossimo is a new name for the memory-safety
projects being run by the Internet Security Research
Group (ISRG), which is the organization behind the Let's Encrypt certificate authority
(CA) project.  Google provided the funds to enable Ojeda to work full-time
on the project starting back in April.


The Linux kernel is at the heart of the modern Internet, from
servers to client devices. It’s on the front line for processing network
data and other forms of input. As such, vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel
can have a wide-ranging impact, putting security and privacy for people,
organizations, and devices at risk. Since it’s written largely in the C
language, which is not memory-safe, memory safety vulnerabilities such as
buffer overflows and use-after-frees are a constant concern. By making it
possible to write parts of the Linux kernel in Rust, which is memory-safe,
we can entirely eliminate memory safety vulnerabilities from certain
components, such as drivers.


We have previously covered another
Prossimo project, which provides funding for
Rustls development, as well as Ojeda's work
on Rust in the kernel.]]></summary>

Developing your own custom Google Chat bot is a great way for users and teams to interact with your solutions and services both directly and within context as they collaborate in Chat. More specifically, Chat bots can be used in group conversations to streamline workflows, assist with activities in the context of discussions, and provide information and notifications in real time. Chat bots can also be used in direct messages, offering a new way to optimize workflows and personal productivity, such as managing project tasks or reporting time activity. Because use cases for bots are varied,  you can consistently reach a growing audience of Chat users over time, directly where they work and uh-hum, chat.

announcement describing the release of a fully

"With FHE, encrypted data can travel across the Internet to a server,
where it can be processed without being decrypted. Google’s transpiler will
enable developers to write code for any type of basic computation such as
simple string processing or math, and run it on encrypted data. The
transpiler will transform that code into a version that can run on
encrypted data. This then allows developers to create new programming
applications that don’t need unencrypted data."  See this

Even developers of database-management systems seem to think that it is

certainly allowing the occasional exercise of one's sense of humor while

not always carry through to developers all over the planet.  Balancing

into some of the privacy implications of the Federated Learning of Cohorts
(FLoC), which is a Google effort to replace
third-party cookies with a different type of identifier that is less
trackable. But less tracking does not equal no tracking. "People's
interests aren't constant and neither are their FLoC IDs. Currently, FLoC
IDs seem to be recomputed every week or so. This means that if a tracker is
able to use other information to link up user visits over time, they can
use the combination of FLoC IDs in week 1, week 2, etc. to distinguish
individual users. This is a particular concern because it works even with
modern anti-tracking mechanisms such as Firefox's Total
Cookie Protection 
(TCP). TCP is intended to prevent trackers from correlating visits across
sites but not multiple visits to one site. FLoC restores cross-site
tracking even if users have TCP enabled."]]></summary>

blog post, Lennart Poettering describes the advantages of using the
unique IDs (UUIDs) and flags from the discoverable partitions
specification to label the entries in a GUID Partition
Table (GPT).  That information can be used to tag disk images if a
self-descriptive way, so that external configuration files (such as
/etc/fstab) are not needed to assemble the filesystems for the
running system.  Systemd can use this information in a variety of ways,
including for running the image in a container: "If a disk image
follows the Discoverable Partition Specification then systemd-nspawn has
all it needs to just boot it up. Specifically, if you have a GPT disk image
in a file foobar.raw and you want to boot it up in a container, just run
systemd-nspawn -i foobar.raw -b, and that's it (you can specify a block
device like /dev/sdb too if you like). It becomes easy and natural to
prepare disk images that can be booted either on a physical machine, inside
a virtual machine manager or inside such a container manager: the necessary
meta-information is included in the image, easily accessible before
actually looking into its file systems."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Extended BPF (eBPF), the general-purpose
execution 
engine inside of the Linux kernel, has proved helpful for tracing and
monitoring the system, for processing network packets, or generally for
extending the behavior of the kernel. So helpful, in fact, that developers
working on other operating systems have been watching it. Dave Thaler and
Poorna Gaddehosur, on behalf of Microsoft, recently
published an implementation of eBPF for Windows. A Linux feature making
its way to Windows, in itself, deserves attention. Even more so when that
feature has brought new degrees of programmability to the Linux kernel over
the last few years. This makes it especially interesting to look at what the
new project can do, and to ponder how the current ecosystem might evolve as
eBPF begins its journey toward Windows.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On the GitHub blog, Kevin Backhouse writes
about a privilege escalation vulnerability in polkit, which
"enables an unprivileged local user to get a root shell on the
system"  CVE-2021-3560
"is triggered by starting a dbus-send command but killing it while
polkit is still in the middle of processing the request. [...] Why does
killing the dbus-send command cause an authentication bypass? The
vulnerability is in step four of the sequence of events listed above. What
happens if polkit asks dbus-daemon for the UID of connection :1.96, but
connection :1.96 no longer exists? dbus-daemon handles that situation
correctly and returns an error. But it turns out that polkit does not
handle that error correctly. In fact, polkit mishandles the error in a
particularly unfortunate way: rather than rejecting the request, it treats
the request as though it came from a process with UID 0. In other words, it
immediately authorizes the request because it thinks the request has come
from a root process."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Annotations in Python came late to the party; they were introduced in
Python 3 as a way to attach information to functions describing their arguments and
return values.  While that mechanism had obvious applications for adding
type information to Python functions, standardized interpretations for the
annotations came later with type hints.
But evaluating the annotations at function-definition time caused some
difficulties, especially with respect to forward references to type names,
so a Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) was created to postpone their
evaluation until they were needed. The PEP-described behavior was set to
become the default in the upcoming Python 3.10 release, but that is
not to be; the postponement of evaluation by default has itself been postponed in the
hopes of unwinding things.]]></summary>

 A little over 10 years ago, we launched the IT Residency Program (ITRP) at Google with a twofold mission: to provide exceptional tech support for Googlers and to empower the next generation of IT pioneers.  
ITRP’s founding principle is learning and development. In addition to formal on-the-job IT support training, the program takes its residents through a focused career development path, including a hands-on rotation in a specific Google function in their chosen specialty. For their part, the residents, who come from a wide spectrum of often non-traditional backgrounds, bring with them a passion for learning. ITRP converts that passion into real-world experience and equips them for a lifelong career in tech.

As we announced at I/O, you can now add proactive notifications and follow-up responses to your Smart Home Action to alert users to events in a timely, relevant and helpful fashion and better engage with your end users.  
 
 Notifications can either alert a user to an event that has occurred without them proactively issuing a request through the Assistant, or as a follow-up to verify that the user's request has been fulfilled.

2019, has quickly become the leading way to perform high-bandwidth,
asynchronous I/O.  It has drawn the attention of many developers, including,
more recently,

of the security 
community are lamenting a perceived lack of thought about security support in
io_uring, and are trying to remedy that shortcoming by adding audit and
Linux security module support there.  That process is proving difficult,

a look at the state of the GNOME Foundation.

[We’ve] got a larger staff team than GNOME has ever had before. We’ve widened the GNOME software ecosystem to include related apps and projects under the GNOME Circle banner, we’ve helped get GTK 4 out of the door, run a wider-reaching program in the Community Engagement Challenge, and consistently supported better infrastructure for both GNOME and the Linux app community in Flathub.

Aside from another grant from Endless (note: my employer), our fundraising hasn’t caught up with this pace of activities. As a result, the Board recently approved a budget for this financial year which will spend more funds from our reserves than we expect to raise in income. Due to our reserves policy, this is essentially the last time we can do this: over the next 6-12 months we need to either raise more money, or start spending less.]]></summary>

You won’t see any difference after the update, but it’s still a big deal. Why? Because Google’s original smart display from 2018 will have a completely new operating system. After years of quiet development, Google’s Fuchsia OS has arrived. […]

complex series of steps required to build an x86 device that only boots
code that the creator wants to run there.  "At this point everything
in the boot process is cryptographically verified, and so should be
difficult to tamper with. Unfortunately this isn't really sufficient - on
x86 systems there's typically no verification of the integrity of the
secure boot database. An attacker with physical access to the system could
attach a programmer directly to the firmware flash and rewrite the secure
boot database to include keys they control. They could then replace the
boot image with one that they've signed, and the machine would happily boot
code that the attacker controlled. We need to be able to demonstrate that
the system booted using the correct secure boot keys, and the only way we
can do that is to use the TPM."]]></summary>

surrounding the idea of increasing the performance of the CPython
interpreter.  At the 2021
Python Language Summit in mid-May, Guido van Rossum announced
that he and a small team are being funded by Microsoft to work with the
community on getting performance improvements upstream into the
interpreter—crucially, without breaking the C API so that the ecosystem of
Python extensions (e.g. NumPy) continue to
work.  Another talk at 
the summit looked
at Cinder, which is a performance-oriented CPython fork that is used in

You might ask, what's the use when there's no taint analysis? That's exactly what we thought - and decided to implement taint analysis in the C# analyzer. Curious about what we accomplished?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The seccomp()
mechanism allows a process to load a BPF program to restrict its future use
of system calls; it is a simple but flexible sandboxing mechanism that is
widely used.  Those filter programs, though, run on the "classic" BPF virtual
machine, rather than the extended BPF
(eBPF) machine used elsewhere in the 
kernel.  Moving seccomp() to eBPF has been an often-requested
change, but security concerns have prevented that from happening.  The
latest attempt to enable eBPF is this patch
set from YiFei Zhu; whether it will succeed where others have failed
remains to be seen.]]></summary>

their performance characteristics.  The most common example is NUMA
architectures, where memory attached to the local node is faster to access
than memory on other nodes.  Recently, persistent memory has
started appearing in deployed systems as well; this type of memory is
byte-addressable like DRAM, but it is available in larger sizes and is slower to

Tamta Kapanadze wishes that she had learned sooner about careers in technology. By the time that the Georgian citizen learned about them, she was already a university student. 
As Kapanadze continued her studies and her interest in technology grew, she wanted to spread the word about the growing field to high-school students in Georgia, a country where the industry is still small. 
To do this, Kapanadze called in the support of Google Developer Student Clubs (GDSCs), community groups for college and university students interested in Google's developer technology. After Kapanadze graduated from university, she continued her work by organizing a chapter of Google Developer Groups (GDGs) for Kutaisi.…]]></summary>

 A closer look at building a Flutter web app with Google Developer products
  
If you attended Google I/O this year, you probably stopped by the Google I/O photo booth for a selfie with our Google Developer mascots: Flutter’s Dash, Android Jetpack, Chrome’s Dino, and Firebase’s Sparky. If you didn’t, it’s not too late to jump in, take a selfie, and share it on social media! We loved seeing all of the pictures you posted and your favorite props! Want to learn more about building a camera plugin, layouts, and gestures used in a photo booth for Flutter on the web? 
 
 It took a combination of Google developer products to make the photo booth successful. The Flutter and Firebase teams joined forces to build a best in class example of Flutter on the web that used Firebase for hosting, auth, performance monitoring, and social sharing. Take a closer look at how the photo booth was built here and then grab the open source code on Github!

At the time of this writing, a few from day 2 are ready as well.  There are lots of interesting topics discussed at the summit, including a talk on making CPython faster from Python creator Guido van Rossum. "Seven months ago, Guido van Rossum left a brief retirement to work at Microsoft. He was given the freedom to pick a project and decided to work on making CPython faster. Microsoft will be funding a small team consisting of Guido van Rossum, Mark Shannon, Eric Snow, and possibly others. [...] The team is optimistic about doubling CPython's speed for 3.11. They plan to try an adaptive, specializing byte code interpreter, which is a bit like the existing inline cache and a bit like the shadow byte code covered in Dino Viehland's talk."  Some of the ideas go back to Shannon's thoughts on speeding up the interpreter that we looked at back in December.]]></summary>

running kernel, they tend to use printk(); that results in a log
entry that is intended — with varying success — to be human-readable.  As it
happens, though, the
consumers of that information are often not human; the kernel's log output
is also read by automated monitoring systems that are looking for
problems.  The result is an impedance mismatch that often ends with the
monitoring system missing important messages.  The printk()
format indexing patch set is the latest of many attempts to improve
this situation.]]></summary>

Chat (IRC) is a longstanding protocol—or series of protocols—for
creating online,
text-based chat rooms.
While many of the "channels" (as chat rooms are usually called) are highly useful to
a wide variety of projects and organizations, including much of the
free-software world,
IRC seems to have a community that suffers from
more than its fair share of disagreements, hostile forks, vitriol, and other types of
divisiveness.  It is perhaps no huge surprise, then, that the IRC
world is currently undergoing another of its periodic upheavals.  The
largest IRC network, freenode, is
embroiled in a messy dispute that has led
to the mass resignation
of many of its volunteer staff, the founding of a competitor network (run by the former staff),
and its abandonment by multiple high-profile projects.]]></summary>

 What is the Mirru App?
 

 
Mirru is a free and open source Android app under development with which one can control robotic prosthetic hands via hand tracking. With our app, a user can instantly mirror grips from their sound hand onto a robotic one, which could be 3D-printed and self-assembled at low cost. With Mirru, we want to provide a cheap, intuitive and open end-to-end alternative to existing, costly, cumbersome and proprietary technology.
