OpenJDK and Java SE updates
OpenJDK is an open source implementation of the Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE), on which multiple companies and contributors collaborate.
A project at OpenJDK represents each new feature release of the Java SE specification. Subsequent updates to those features, including functional and security fixes, are led by maintainers working in the JDK updates project. Long-term supported releases such as Java SE 8 (since March 2014), Java SE 11 (since Sept 2018), and Java SE 17 (since Sept 2021) undergo a quarterly release update under the guidance of a …]]></summary>

TL;DR: If you’re attending @DrupalConEur submit your URL @ https://bit.ly/CWV-DrupalCon-22 to get your UX & performance right on #Drupal at the Tag1 & Google interactive workshop.


Getting your User Experience right, which includes performance, is critical for success. It’s a key driver of many success metrics (https://web.dev/tags/web-vitals) and a factor taken into account by platforms, including search engines, that surface links to your site (https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/experience/page-experience).
Quantifying User Experience is not always easy, so one way to measure, track and improve it is by using Core Web Vitals (CWV, https://web.dev/vitals/). Building a site with great CWV on Drupal is easier than on many platforms on average (https://bit.ly/CWV-tech-report) and yet there are certain tips and pitfalls you should be aware of.  
In this workshop the team from Tag1 and Google (Michael Meyers, Andrey Lipattsev and others) will use real life examples of Drupal-based websites to illustrate some common pain points and the corresponding solutions. If you would like us to take a look at your website and provide actionable advice, please submit the URL via this link (https://bit.ly/CWV-DrupalCon-22). The Workshop is interactive, so bring your laptop - we'll get you up and running and teach you hands-on how to code for the relevant improvements.
We cannot guarantee that all the submissions will be analysed as this depends on the number of submissions and the time that we have. However, we will make sure that all the major themes cutting across the submitted sites will be covered with relevant solutions.
See you in Prague!

https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2021/05/fuzzing-ios-code-on-macos-at-native.html
본 포스팅에서는 해당 글에 대한 약간의 번역 + 내 나름대로의 분석 + 실험을 해보려고 한다.
우선 Samuel에 따르면 macOS에 존재하지 않는 iOS 관련 런타임 라이브러리와 프레임웍들이 /System/iOSSupport 형태로 제공되기 때문에 대부분 호환이 가능할 것으로 전망했다. 
그렇다면 이를 이용하면 단순히 애플리케이션 형태 뿐만 아니라, iOS용 바이너리와 라이브러리 파일들도 macOS에서 구동할 수 있을 것이다. 이렇게 된다면 iOS용으로 컴파일된 상용 프로그램을 퍼징할 때 보다 성능이 좋은 macOS 컴퓨터에서 수행할 수 있다는 장점이 있다. 그리고 iOS 코드를 동적으로 분석하는 경우에도 보다 용이한 환경이 제공된다.
우리의 목표는 임의의 iOS용 바이너리와 라이브러리들을 iOS와 동일한 수준으로 macOS환경에서 직접 구동할 것이다. 이를 실험하기 위해 몇가지 코드를 테스트할 것이다. 기본적으로 실험에 사용된 환경은 SIP(System Inte…]]></summary>

detailed look at garbage collection in Git and the work that has been
done to make it faster.


	To solve this problem, we turned to a long-discussed idea on the
	Git mailing list: cruft packs. The idea is simple: store an
	auxiliary list of mtime data alongside a pack containing
	just unreachable objects. To garbage collect a repository, Git
	places the unreachable objects in a pack. That pack is designated
	as a “cruft pack” because Git also writes the mtime data
	corresponding to each object in a separate file alongside that
	pack. This makes it possible to update the mtime of a
	single unreachable object without changing the mtimes of
	any other unreachable object.]]></summary>

two-year-old CVE, but such is the case for a recent
Python release of four versions of the language.  The bug is a

For instance, using regular expressions, you could find all the instances of the word cat in a document, or all instances of a word that begins with c and ends with t.
Use of regular expressions in the real world can get much more complex—and powerful—than that. For example, imagine you need to write code verifying that all content in the body of an HTTP POST request is free of script injection attacks. Malicious code can appear in any number of ways, but you know that injected script code will always appear between  HTML tags.

Emoji have long eclipsed their humble beginnings in sms text messages in the 1990’s.

For last month’s digest, see Kafka Monthly Digest: July 2022.
Releases
There is currently one release in progress, 3.3.0.
3.3.0
The release process for 3.3.0 continued. José Armando García Sancio published the first release candidate on August 29. A few issues, including KAFKA-14187 and KAFKA-14156, were found during testing, so José built RC1 on September 1. The vote is currently ongoing. You can find the release plan in the wiki.
Kafka Improvement Proposals
Last month, the community submitted three Kafka Improvement Proposals (KIPs) (KIP-863 to KIP-865). I'll highlight a couple of them:

Kevin Davin has always had a passion for learning and helping others learn, no matter their background or unique challenges they may face. He explains, “I want to learn something new every day, I want to help others learn, and I’m addicted to learning.” This mantra is evident in everything he does from giving talks at numerous conferences to helping people from underrepresented groups overcome imposter syndrome and even helping them become GDEs. In addition to learning, Kevin is also passionate about diversity and inclusion efforts, partly inspired by navigating the world with partial blindness.

For example, comparing long with size_t might give different results than long with unsigned short. C++20 brings some help, and there’s no need to learn all the complex rules :)



     
    


Let’s have a look at two comparisons:
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    long a = -100;
    unsigned short b = 100;
    std::cout << (a < b);   // 1
    size_t c = 100;
    std::cout << (a < c);   // 2
}   


If you run the code @Compiler Explorer (GCC 12, x86-64, default flags) you’ll see:
10


Why? Why not 11?
(By the way, I asked that question on Twitter, see https://twitter.com/fenbf/status/1568566458333990914 - thank you for all the answers and hints)

concerned by the fact that there is only one compiler available; there are

significantly, which is why the kernel has a "transparent huge page"

be helpful if most of the memory contained within it is actually in use;

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[기본적으로 Apple iOS앱들은 암호화(Encrypted) 되어 있을 수 있다. 하지만 아무리 보안을 위해 암호화를 했다하더라도, 실행을 하기 위해서는 반드시 암호화를 해제한 상태로 구동을 하게 된다. 이 시점에 복호화된 애플리케이션을 덤프해서 원본 IPA를 획득할 수 있을 것이다.
이런 경우에 사용되는 도구가 frida-ios-dump이다.
https://github.com/AloneMonkey/frida-ios-dump

사전 준비 
이 글에서는 사전준비가 미리 되어있다고 가정하겠다. 필요한 부분은 이전 블로그 게시글을 확인하면 좋다.
- 탈옥한 iphone : https://cpuu.postype.com/post/10436260
- frida 도구 설치 방법 : https://cpuu.postype.com/post/10415747


Frida-ios-dump 설치
% git clone https://github.com/AloneMonkey/frida-ios-dump.git
% cd frida-ios-dump/
% pip3 install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
설치가 완료되면 dump.py 파일이 존재하는데, 여기에서 아래의 정보를 알맞게 입력해야 한다.
User = 'root'
Password = 'alpine'
Host = 'IP주소'
Port = 22
탈옥된 아이폰이 root 계정 비밀번호가 alpine 이라고 할 때, 동일한 네트워크라면 192 또는 172로 시작하는 주소를 찾아서 입력하면 되고, ssh port 도 기본은 22 이지만 필요한 경우 알맞게 변경하면 된다.


애플리케이션 추출
dump 파이썬 스크립트에서 -l 옵션을 이용한다.
또는 frida-ps 를 사용해도 같다.


이렇게 확인된 Identifier 값을 입력하면 된다. 참고로 덤프를 할 때 해당 디바이스는 화면 잠금이 해제된 상태여야만 작업이 진행된다.


추출된 IPA 파일은 사실상 압축된 형태의 내용으로, unzip 명령어를 사용하면 해제가 가능하다.
% unzip unc0ver.ipa
디렉토리 내부에 보면 arm64 형식의 Mach-O 바이너리 파일을 획득할 수 있다.
% file unc0ver
unc0ver: Mach-O 64-bit executable arm64
리버스 엔지니어링을 하면 된다.

 A medical game for doctors, a language game for kids, a scary game for horror lovers and an escape room game for thrill seekers! In this latest batch of #WeArePlay stories, we’re celebrating the founders behind a wonderful variety of games from all over the world. Have a read and get gaming! 

To start, let’s meet Sam from Chicago. Coming from a family of doctors, his Dad challenged him to make a game to help those in the medical field. Sam agreed, made a game and months later discovered over 100,000 doctors were able to practice medical procedures. This early success inspired him to found Level Ex - a company of 135, making world-class medical games for doctors across the globe. Despite his achievements, his Dad still hopes Sam may one day get into medicine himself and clinch a Nobel prize.   




Next, a few more stories from around the world:

Aldo and Sandro from Peru - founders of Dark Dome. They combine storytelling and art to make thrilling and chilling games, filled with plot twists and jump scares.






Vladimir, Tomislav and Boris from Croatia - founders of Pine Studio. They won the Indie Games Festival 2021 with their game Cats In Time. 





Kelly, Mikk, Reimo and Madde from Estonia - founders of ALPA kids. Their language games for children have a huge impact on early education and language preservation.





Check out all the stories now at g.co/play/weareplay and stay tuned for even more coming soon.

modules from various locations (and the modules they import) get added
into the application process.  All of that occurs before the application
even gets started doing whatever it is the user actually launched it for;
that delay can be significant—and annoying.  Beyond that, many of those
imports may not be necessary at all for the code path being followed, so
eagerly doing the import is purely wasted time.  A proposal back in May
would add a way for applications to choose lazy imports, where the import
is deferred until the module is actually used.]]></summary>

CVE-2020-10735
Converting between int and str in bases other than 2 (binary), 4, 8 (octal), 16 (hexadecimal), or 32 such as base 10 (decimal) now raises a ValueError if the number of digits in string form is above a limit to avoid potential denial of service attacks due to the algorithmic complexity.
Security releases for 3.9.14, 3.8.14, and 3.7.14 are made available simultaneously to address this issue, along with some less urgent security content.
Upgrading your installations is highly recommended.

When adopting GitOps, organizations must plan carefully to divide tasks and configuration files appropriately between repositories and directories in each repository. Standard practices have long existed for using Git-based workflows for infrastructure and software delivery. But with the dawn of cloud-native architectures and Kubernetes, you can now automate a wide range of deployments based on declarations stored in a Git repository.
The question of best practices comes up a lot when creating repositories for GitOps. There is no magic bullet, but several common patterns exist to match the various ways the organization interacts internally.

In August, we published tutorials to help you improve the observability of your microservices, build security into your Node.js development process, easily containerize .NET applications, and more. Let's dive into the August highlights.
Containerize .NET applications automatically
To run a .NET application in a container, you need a Dockerfile—but writing and managing Dockerfiles can be tedious. Enter the dotnet build-image tool, which enables you to create a container image from a .NET application without writing a Dockerfile.
In one of our most popular articles from the past month, Tom Deseyn shows you how to use build-image …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Peter Eckersley, one of the original founders of the Let's Encrypt non-profit TLS certificate authority, has died suddenly, as reported by Seth Schoen:

Peter was the leader of EFF's contributions to Let's Encrypt and ACME over the course of several years during which these technologies turned from a wild idea into an important part of Internet infrastructure. He also took a lot of initiative in coalescing the EFF, Mozilla, and University of Michigan teams into a single team and a single project. He later served on the initial board of directors of the Internet Security Research Group.
[...]
Toward the end of his life, Peter focused his career on ethics and safety of artificial intelligence, and he founded the AI Objectives Institute to examine the concrete parallels he saw between surprising and undesirable outcomes that can emerge within economies and those that can emerge in machine learning systems.


More about Eckersley can be found at his web site, on his Wikipedia page, and in a Hacker News discussion.]]></summary>

There are many reasons against development in the environment that will ultimately run the container, such as cost, speed, tooling, and so on. Creating a container that works on your PC requires a local development environment that gives you the complete experience of coding, building, debugging, and running—and then pushes all pieces of the container to a host or cloud service. The best way to describe this process is tantamount to encapsulating your entire software building experience into one file and then sending it off to a server.

break out of (or 
continue) more than one level of nested loops in Python recently
took place in the Ideas
category of the language's discussion forum.  The idea is
attractive, at least in an abstract sense—some other languages support
jumping out of 
multiple loops at once—but it seems unlikely to go anywhere for Python.
The barrier to new features is fairly high, for sure, but there is also a
need for proponents to provide real-world examples that demonstrate their
advantages.  That, too, is a difficult bar to clear, as was seen in the

look at file-history queries.


	If these history modes usually have the same output, then why

	does simplified history speed up the query by skipping a large
	portion of commits, it also allows iterative output. The simplified
	history can output portions of the history without walking the
	entire history. By contrast, the --simplify-merges algorithm is
	defined recursively starting at commits with no parents. Git cannot
	output a single result until walking all reachable commits and

Run multiple containers on Kubernetes
Running a container with Docker or Podman is great, but it's only a start. To implement an entire system, you need several services (or microservices, if you will). Kubernetes can orchestrate the entire system in a namespace, giving you both isolation from other namespaces and a shared environment within a namespace.

the engineers responsible for each side of the interface together in a room

truth to it.
One of the challenges of working with Open Source anything really is debugging.
To be successful, an open source engineer needs to commit their time to
supporting their design–no matter how it is used.  As an illustration, what
happens when one engineer uses an open source design, uses it inappropriately,
and then declares that it doesn’t work?  It can reflect poorly on the quality
of the design–even if the design was and remains fully functional.

Liza Goldberg learned to code through Google Earth Engine at age fourteen, when her mentors at NASA, where she was an intern, introduced the tool as a way to model global trends in environmental change. Liza, who had arrived at NASA with no coding or remote sensing experience, gradually gained expertise in the platform, thanks to strong mentorship, Google training, and guidance from the Google Earth Engine developer community.

To take a somewhat different angle on the subject, this article will describe how a container image is constructed and executed using a non-traditional, conversational approach.
First, let's take a quick look at the layers of a container image and how they relate to one another.
What is a container image?
Briefly, an image is an operating system that runs libraries and runtimes and an application, all enclosed in an Open Container Initiative (OCI) compliant file.
Figure 1 illustrates an example: a Node.js application that uses the Express library, running on the Red Hat Universal Base Image (UBI) operating system. If you're not familiar with …]]></summary>

Have a look:
void foo() {
    std::string str0;
    std::string str1 {};
}


We have two local variables (with automatic storage duration), str0 is default initialized, while str1 is value initialized.
While default initialization is unsafe for integers or other built-in types, it’s relatively fine (but less readable) for class types with a default constructor. In that case, a default constructor will be called, and the string object will get an empty value. The same constructor is invoked for value initialization.
Nevertheless, it’s best to set a value:

We recently spoke with Ceren Tunay, a Google Developer Group Organizer in Edirne, Turkey.   who notes, “while we were organizing events, I noticed people have a huge passion for tech. I asked myself, "what is that thing in tech that makes people so impassioned? And after that, I started to better understand the tech industry, thanks to the programs offered by Google Developer Groups. Then I decided to learn to code. After a while, now I know that I am where I want to be, and realized I have worked towards finding my dream job.”

      a range of values, such as all names from "a" to "f", then they'll need to

Until recently, many optimizations worked only when the loop index was an int variable. This article shows how the HotSpot virtual machine was upgraded to add the same optimizations for long variables. The article covers particularly out-of-bounds checking (also called range checks).
Why optimization was added for long variables
One of the important promises of Java, along with many other modern languages, is to catch out-of-bounds errors, such as when you mistakenly end a loop at array.length instead of at array.length-1. The HotSpot virtual machine eliminates range checks when possible as a performance optimization. As discussed in a previous article, the JIT com…]]></summary>

for late-bound function argument defaults") has been going on—in fits and

October. The idea is to provide a way

scope of the function 
call, which will allow more concise, and visible, defaults.  But there has
been a persistent complaint that what the
language needs is a more-general 
deferred computation feature; late-bound defaults would simply fall out as
one specific user of the feature.   The arrival of a proposal for deferred
computation did not really 
accomplish that goal, however.]]></summary>

The challenges faced by women founders is evident. Despite an increase in total venture funding raised by women-led startups in recent years, women founders still secured only 2% of the total amount invested in VC-backed startups throughout the year. In addition, a recent report on women-founded companies in Canada noticed that women technology entrepreneurs travel longer routes from startup to scale-up, with women in the study doing more funding pitches than men and taking longer to raise their Series A financing.

engines can greatly simplify many aspects of deploying a server-side

Managing a group of containers only gets harder as additional applications

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Electronic Frontier Foundation has announced that it is representing cryptography professor Matthew Green, who has chosen to republish the sanctioned Tornado Cash open-source code as a GitHub repository. 

EFF’s most central concern about OFAC’s [US Office of Foreign Assets Control] actions arose because, after the SDN [Specially Designated Nationals] listing of “Tornado Cash,” GitHub took down the canonical repository of the Tornado Cash source code, along with the accounts of the primary developers, including all their code contributions. While GitHub has its own right to decide what goes on its platform, the disappearance of this source code from GitHub after the government action raised the specter of government action chilling the publication of this code.  

In keeping with our longstanding defense of the right to publish code, we are representing Professor Matthew Green, who teaches computer science at the Johns Hopkins Information Security Institute, including applied cryptography and anonymous cryptocurrencies. Part of his work involves studying and improving privacy-enhancing technologies, and teaching his students about mixers like Tornado Cash. The disappearance of Tornado Cash’s repository from GitHub created a gap in the available information on mixer technology, so Professor Green made a fork of the code, and posted the replica so it would be available for study. The First Amendment protects both GitHub’s right to host that code, and Professor Green’s right to publish (here republish) it on GitHub so he and others can use it for teaching, for further study, and for development of the technology.]]></summary>

You'll also see how to get the code up and running for multiple containerized tenants in a Kubernetes cluster, and how to expose the service to clients.
A key aspect of SaaS architecture is a generic code base used by all tenants running in the Kubernetes cluster. The application logic used by each tenant is encapsulated in a Linux container image that's declared within the definition of the tenant's Kubernetes deployment. We'll see multi…]]></summary>

with Alder Lake CPUs
lacks support in Linux, and is unlikely to get it anytime soon.  The
problem highlighted here goes beyond just Intel, though.]]></summary>
