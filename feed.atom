that it has adopted a new governance framework:
The OpenSSL Management Committee (OMC) has been dissolved, and two
boards of directors have been elected for the Foundation and the Corporation. Each
organization has ten voting members. These boards share all the
responsibilities and authorities of the former OMC co-equally.
To further engage our communities, we are establishing two advisory
committees for each entity: a Business Advisory Committee (BAC) and a
Technical Advisory Committee (TAC). The communities will elect the
members of the BACs and TACs, creating a direct channel for community
input in roadmap development and reflecting the diverse perspectives
of OpenSSL's communities.
OpenSSL has also announced that two projects have adopted the OpenSSL Mission
and become OpenSSL
projects: Bouncy Castle, which provides
cryptographic APIs for Java and C#, and the cryptlib security
software development toolkit. See the announcement for full details.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's Encrypt has
announced
that it intends to end support "as soon as possible" for the 

Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) over privacy concerns. OCSP was developed as a
lighter-weight alternative to

Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) that did not involve downloading
the entire CRL in order to check whether a certificate was valid. Let's Encrypt will continue
supporting OCSP as long as it is a requirement for Microsoft's

Trusted Root Program, but hopes to discontinue it soon:



We plan to end support for OCSP primarily because it represents a considerable risk to privacy on the Internet. When someone visits a website using a browser or other software that checks for certificate revocation via OCSP, the Certificate Authority (CA) operating the OCSP responder immediately becomes aware of which website is being visited from that visitor's particular IP address. Even when a CA intentionally does not retain this information, as is the case with Let's Encrypt, CAs could be legally compelled to collect it. CRLs do not have this issue.



People using Let's Encrypt as their CA should, for the most part, not need to change their setups.
All modern browsers support CRLs, so end-users shouldn't notice an impact either.]]></summary>

are thankful for their insight and guidance on how we can work
together and be thoroughly and consistently supportive of the

So far the PSF has set up office
hours to improve communications, published
a retrospective on the DjangoCon Africa review, and put out a transparency
report on grants from the past two years. The PSF board has also
voted to "use the same criteria for all grant requests, no matter

an article announcing some new releases of the Llama large language
model and going on at length about why open-source models are important:


	AI has more potential than any other modern technology to increase
	human productivity, creativity, and quality of life – and to
	accelerate economic growth while unlocking progress in medical and
	scientific research. Open source will ensure that more people
	around the world have access to the benefits and opportunities of
	AI, that power isn't concentrated in the hands of a small number of
	companies, and that the technology can be deployed more evenly and
	safely across society.

	There is an ongoing debate about the safety of open source AI
	models, and my view is that open source AI will be safer than the
	alternatives. I think governments will conclude it's in their
	interest to support open source because it will make the world more
	prosperous and safer.


Of course, whether Llama is truly open source is debatable at best, but it
is more open than many of the alternatives.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deploying a Red Hat OpenShift operator in an online environment is a breeze! OpenShift will simply pull the required images from public registries, and voila, we're good to use it without any hassle.
However, the game changes when we're working in a disconnected environment. For most customers, keeping their servers off the internet is a top priority due to security concerns. Suddenly, deploying an OpenShift operator becomes more intricate and we can't rely on public registries anymore. Instead, we need to gather all the necessary container images and make sure they're available within our disconnected environment. Only then can we successfully deploy an operator on OpenShift.

Workstation Working Group, has taken another
swing at persuading the Fedora Project to allow metrics related to

proposal, aimed for Fedora 40, was withdrawn to be reworked
based on feedback. This time around, the proponents have shifted from
asking for opt-out telemetry to opt-in metrics, with more detail about
what would be collected and the policies that would govern data collection. The
change seems to be on its way to approval by the Fedora Engineering

In our initial learning we followed the most common path by using one of the most popular models from Hugging Face and using tools like ollama and node-llama-cpp to run the models. However, not all models are created equal, and there are a number of aspects that should be considered when choosing a model. The article "Why trust open source AI" is a good introduction to a number of them.

Now that we have KServe installed, it's time to deploy a model. In this post, we will register the popular SKlearn runtime as a custom ServingRuntime and deploy the iris model.
While KServe makes it very easy to deploy models, it doesn't mean that everyone should have access to these models. Restricting access to certain individuals helps conserve resources. In this example, the runtime is CPU-based, but if you're using a GPU-based runtime, this resource issue becomes even more significant. Open Data Hub (ODH) and Red Hat OpenShift AI have made it simpler than ever with the integration of Authorino into the model serving components from ODH 2.10 and OpenShift AI 2.9.

as The Register reports. More than 60 organizations have signed on to an open letter asking the
EC to reconsider:



We find this transformation incomprehensible, moreover when NGI has proven efficient and economical to support free software as a whole, from the smallest to the most established initiatives. This ecosystem diversity backs the strength of European technological innovation, and maintaining the NGI initiative to provide structural support to software projects at the heart of worldwide innovation is key to enforce the sovereignty of a European infrastructure.
Contrary to common perception, technical innovations often originate from European rather than North American programming communities, and are mostly initiated by small-scaled organizations.]]></summary>

NumPy project 
released version 2.0.0 on
June 16, the first major release of the widely
used Python-based numeric-computing library since 2006. The release has been planned for some
time, as an opportunity to clean up NumPy's API. As with most NumPy updates,
there are performance improvements to several individual functions. There are only a few new
features, but several backward-incompatible changes, including a change to
NumPy's numeric-promotion rules. Changes to the Python API require relatively minor changes to
Python code using the library, but the changes to the C API may be more
difficult to adapt to. In
both cases, the official

migration guide describes what needs to be adapted to the new version.]]></summary>

On some systems, security policies have been established to limit execution
to specifically approved programs.  But there are files that are not
executed directly by the kernel; these include scripts fed to language
interpreters like Python, Perl, or a shell.  An attacker who is able to get
an interpreter to execute a file may be able to bypass a system's security

Objectively, this means metadata of loading classes in Java are set in the non-heap region also known as the native region of the memory (again, not inside the heap).
This Metaspace region is a change from previous versions, which had Java Metaspace as part of the heap in the so-called "Permanent Generation" and was set using the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) flag: PermSize and MaxPermSize. 
Although this discussion is very well settled, this article aims to review Metaspace, its tuning, and the consequences for container and non-container usage. It also adds troubleshooting steps in case those are needed.

The feather is a well-loved and iconic part of the ASF brand. We know of community members who have ASF feather tattoos. People love taking photos with the feather at our flagship event each year. 

So why would we change it? As a non-Indigenous entity, we acknowledge that it is inappropriate for the Foundation to use Indigenous themes or language. We thank Natives in Tech and other members of the broader open source community for bringing this issue to the forefront. Today we are announcing we will be retiring the feather icon and logo and replacing it with a new logo that embodies the Foundation's rich history of providing software for the public good.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Schematic reviews are a part of the hardware development cycle in many if not
most, hardware development companies. Typically led by the electrical
engineering team, it is easy to overlook design issues that will be important to
the firmware team. This post tells of a few stories of design misses that I have
made and puts some common lessons learned into a checklist for other firmware
engineers. It is not meant to be an exhaustive list, but rather a starting point
for a firmware engineer to build their own checklist with the goal of helping
teams catch software/hardware interaction bugs earlier in the design cycle when
they’re cheaper to fix.

the path to safer flexible arrays in the kernel, thanks to the
counted_by attribute supported by Clang 18 and GCC 15.


	There are a number of requirements to properly use the
	counted_by attribute. One crucial requirement is that the
	counter must be initialized before the first reference to the
	flexible-array member. Another requirement is that the array must
	always contain at least as many elements as indicated by the
	counter.

Apps and Stacks container images can be divided into two groups: 

Source-to-Image (S2I) images 
No Source-to-Image (NoS2I) images

Source-to-Image (S2I) is a toolkit and workflow for building reproducible container images from source code.
S2I images are:

S2i-nodejs-container
S2i-php-container
S2i-ruby-container
S2i-python-container
Nginx-container
httpd-container

NoS2I images are:

Postgresql-container
Mysql-container
mariadb-container
Redis-container
varnish-container

Apps and Stacks container images support several operating systems like Fedora, CentOS Stream 8 (C8S), CentOS Stream 9 (C9S), Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8, and RHEL 9, and soon also RHEL 10. CentOS7 and RHE…]]></summary>

draft design calls for them to be implemented nearly completely in user space.



So far, the signals project has been going according to plan, and
hopefully, POSIX support for signals will be mostly complete by the
end of summer, with in-kernel improvements to process management.
After that, work on the userspace process manager will begin,
possibly including new kernel performance and/or functionality
improvements to facilitate this.]]></summary>

Following the open source model of Red Hat, those extensions for Ansible have both a community version and a productized version. To help users better understand the philosophy behind this approach, this article explains in detail the differences between each option and how they can be used.
Many, if not all, Red Hat products have origins in open source or free software communities and are developed by both contributors of the project and employees of the company. A few famous examples include Red Hat Enterprise Lin…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Change can be hard. This is especially true when applying a new set of technologies or approaches. Fortunately, image mode for RHEL takes many of the benefits that are found in container technologies, including a simplified build process and portability across a variety of environments, and applies them to traditional Virtual Machine workflows. In the prior post, Creating a VMDK using image mode for RHEL, a VMDK-formatted disk image was produced as an output from a bootc image.  
While the VMDK format is open source, they are traditionally used within the VMware family of solutions, such as VMware Workstation and VMware vSphere. In this post, we will describe how the previously created VMDK disk can be used as the basis for a virtual machine hosted in a VMware vSphere environment.

By enabling a familiar container image assembly process that supports several popular output types, end users have the flexibility to choose where and how they want to operate.
One of the supported output formats is a Virtual Machine Disk (VMDK), which is commonly used within VMware’s supported virtualization platforms, like vSphere, but support is also available elsewhere, including VirtualBox. Bridging the gap between traditional operating environments and cloud-native technologies is one of the benefits that image mode provides.

released
the 6.10 kernel.


	So the final week was perhaps not quite as quiet as the preceding
	ones, which I don't love - but it also wasn't noisy enough to
	warrant an extra rc.



Changes in 6.10 include
the removal of support for some ancient Alpha CPUs,
shadow-stack support for the x32 sub-architecture,
Rust-language support on RISC-V systems,
support for some Windows NT synchronization
primitives (though it is marked "broken" in 6.10),
the mseal() system call,
fsverity
support in the FUSE filesystem subsystem,
ioctl() support in the Landlock security
module,
the memory-allocation profiling subsystem,
and more.


See the LWN merge-window summaries (part 1, part 2) and the KernelNewbies 6.10 page
for more details.]]></summary>

On behalf of the whole GNOME community, the Board of Directors
would like to give our utmost thanks to Holly for her achievements
during the past 10 months, including drafting a bold five-year
strategic plan for the Foundation, securing two important fiscal
sponsorship agreements with GIMP and Black Python Devs, writing our
first funding proposal that will now enable the Foundation to apply
for more grants, vastly improving our financial operations, and
implementing a break-even budget to preserve our financial

The Foundation's Interim Executive Director, Richard Littauer,
brings years of open source leadership as part of his work as an
organizer of SustainOSS and CURIOSS, as a sustainability coordinator
at the Open Source Initiative, and as a community development manager
at Open Source Collective, and through open source contributions to
many projects, such as Node.js and IPFS. The Board appointed Richard
in June and is confident in his ability to guide the Foundation during
this transitional period.

USENIX paper by Hongyu Li et al. is not entirely clear, but it does
show that the Rust-for-Linux project is gaining wider attention.


	Despite more novice developers being attracted by Rust to the

	constructing Rust-relevant toolchains as well as Rust crates alone;
	they do not, however, take part in kernel code development. By
	contrast, 5 out of 6 investigated drivers (as seen in Table 5) are
	mainly contributed by authors from the Linux community. This

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Doug Brown documents
the long journey to fixing a bug in the GDebi utility for
installing Debian packages. He first encountered the bug in
Ubuntu MATE 18.04: "at the time I just ignored this
issue. I didn't want to deal with it. I went off to the trusty Linux
terminal and installed Chrome that way instead".
Two and a half years ago, I committed to doing more open-source
contributions in my free time and was finally irritated enough about
this problem to look into it. I searched around for more info. Lo and
behold, lots
of people
were also
affected and there was already an
issue from 2019 on Ubuntu's bug tracker about it.
[...] As is commonly the case in software development, the difficult part of
this fix had nothing to do with the code itself. All of my effort was
spent figuring out Ubuntu's patch submission processes and advocating
for my merge request. Nobody else seemed to be interested in doing the
work to actually fix this bug that has been plaguing Ubuntu MATE and
Xubuntu, not to mention some Debian users, for over 6 years. After
dealing with the long process of getting my merge request approved, I
think I'm starting to understand why!


Brown notes that the fix is
now packaged for the upcoming Ubuntu 24.10 release, and should be
backported to 22.04 and 24.04 eventually.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fedora Atomic Desktop
and Fedora IoT systems installed
before Fedora 40 may fail to boot after an update if secure boot
is enabled. Fedora Magazine has a
post by Timothée Ravier about the problem, how users can work
around it, and what the project is doing to avoid the similar problems
in the future:
On Fedora Atomic Desktops and Fedora IoT systems, the components
that are part of the boot chain (Shim, GRUB) are not (yet)
automatically updated alongside the rest of the system. Thus, if you
have installed a Fedora Atomic Desktop or a Fedora IoT system before
Fedora 40, it uses an old versions of the Shim and bootloader binaries
to boot your system.
When Secure Boot is enabled, the EFI firmware loads Shim
first. Shim is signed by the Microsoft Third Party Certificate
Authority so that it can be verified on most hardware out of the
box. The Shim binary includes the Fedora certificates used to verify
binaries signed by Fedora. Then Shim loads GRUB, which in turn loads
the Linux kernel. Both are signed by Fedora.
Until recently, the kernel binaries where signed two times, with an
older key and a newer one. With the 6.9 kernel update, the kernel is
no longer signed with the old key. If GRUB or Shim is old enough and
does not know about the new key, the signature verification fails.]]></summary>

to be used by various Linux tracing tools (e.g. ftrace, perf, uprobes,

required for multiple instances of tracefs, as Steven Rostedt described in
a session at the 2022
Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit.  He returned to the 2024
edition of the summit to talk further about how to make pseudo (or virtual)

	runs with reduced privileges compared to the parent server process.
	So immediate impact is lower.  However, there may be differences in

The answer is that automation is a key aspect of modern IT operations, which is why we at Red Hat are delighted to announce that the deployment and configuration of Microsoft SQL Server on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) can be easily automated using Ansible and corresponding RHEL system roles for SQL Server.

One department would like metrics retention for a period of 3 months whereas another department requested metrics retention for 6 months.
One department requested remote_writes to an external server for metrics matching one pattern and to a different server for metrics matching another pattern. This group changes their requirements every few weeks.
One department uses a Prometheus exporter to dump all their data to Prometheus for easy viewing in Grafana and is overloading the Prometheus server causing it to use many G-bytes of RAM which results in poor Prometheus query response…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On his blog, Behdad Esfahbod has published a lengthy and detailed look at the state of open-source text rendering.  It looks at the libraries available, application support, future directions, and gives a summary analysis of the ecosystem. 


In broad strokes, OpenType added support for color fonts, variable fonts, and the Universal Shaping Engine. The Free & Open Source stack supports all of these advances at the lower level, but application UI support has been slower to arrive. The Open Source text stack also gained enormous market-share when Android and Google Chrome fully embraced it.

Looking forward, there is a Rust migration of the text stack underway, which will unify font compilation and consumption under a safe programming language. Incremental Font Transfer will enable streaming fonts to web browsers. And my proposed Wasm-fonts will enable more expressive fonts.]]></summary>

Marta Lewandowska gave a talk to discuss a
new approach for booting Linux systems, "No more boot
loader: Please use the kernel instead". The talk, available on
YouTube, introduced a new project called nmbl (for "no more bootloader",
pronounced "nimble"). The idea is to get rid of bootloaders (e.g., 
GNU GRUB) with a
Unified
Kernel Image (UKI) that removes the need for a separate bootloader
altogether. It is early days for nmbl, currently the project is only
being tested for use with virtual machines, but the idea is
compelling. If successful, nmbl could offer security, performance, and
maintenance benefits compared to GRUB and other separate bootloaders.]]></summary>

to shake the screws and kick the tires on what should become a new verification
product shortly.
I thought that a good design to check might be my
SDIO project.  It has roughly all the
pieces in place, and so makes sense for an automated testing pipeline.
This weekend, the CI project engineer shared with me:
It’s literally the first time I get to know a good hardware project needs
such many verifications and testings!  There’s even a real SD card
simulation model and RW test…
After reminiscing about this for a bit, I thought it might be worth taking a

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like many kernel subsystems, the Linux security module (LSM) subsystem
makes extensive use of indirect function calls.  Those calls, however, are
increasingly problematic, and the pressure to remove them has been growing. 
The good news is that there is a patch
series from KP Singh that accomplishes that goal.  Its progress into
the mainline has been slow — this change was first proposed
by Brendan Jackman and Paul Renauld in 2020 — and this work has been caught
up in some wider controversies along the way, but it should be close to
being ready.]]></summary>

Today, there is a big landscape of messaging platforms, and often people feel divided on which one to use to communicate with friends and family.
In the professional field, organizations usually mandate one common communication platform, but often more than one survives, fragmenting work discussions between them.

peports (pronounced like purports), which aid manual symbol
inspection and complement one another. As of this writing, the latter is
not yet in a release, but it’s feature-complete and trivial to build if
you wanted to try it out early. This article explains the motivation and
purpose for each.
vc++filt
Binutils has c++filt, a tool to demangle C++ symbols. Its primary use

doesn’t look like a mangled C++ symbol, and interpolating human-friendly
names in place of mangled symbols. In, say, Vim I could run the current
buffer through it to translate mangled symbols (:%!c++filt).
Otherwise it’s often composed with other tools in a pipeline.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Image-based upgrades (IBU) are a developer preview feature in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.15 that reduce the time required to upgrade a single node OpenShift cluster. The image-based upgrade can perform both Z and Y stream upgrades, include operator upgrades in the image, and rollback to the previous version manually or automatically upon failure. Image-based upgrade can also directly upgrade OpenShift Container Platform 4.y to 4.y+2, whereas a traditional OpenShift upgrade would require two separate upgrades to achieve the same end result (4.Y to 4.Y+1 to 4.Y+2). 
An image-based upgrade consists of several stages that the Lifecycle Agent will take a cluster through. Those stages are prep, upgrade, rollback, and idle. The prep stage can be completed outside a maintenance window …]]></summary>

containers on FreeBSD:


Doug Rabson began by providing an overview of the current state of
FreeBSD support for OCI containers, noting that while FreeBSD has long
supported containers through its jail and vnet features, the ecosystem
around OCI containers requires further development. "FreeBSD has been
able to do containers for a long time, but we need to align better
with OCI standards to make our containers more compatible and easier
to use," Rabson remarked​​.]]></summary>

a summary of "papercut fixes" for GNOME tablet support that are
planned to ship with GNOME 47.
If you're an avid tablet user, you may have multiple stylus tools -
but it's also likely that you have multiple tools of the same type
which makes differentiating them in the GUI hard. Which is why they're
highlighted now - if you bring the tool into proximity, the matching
image is highlighted to make it easier to know which stylus you're
about to configure. Oh, and in the process we added a new SVG for AES
styli too to make the picture look more like the actual physical
tool. The <blink> tag may no longer be cool but at least we can disco
our way through the stylus configuration now.]]></summary>

MIT-licensed programming language, in development since 2013, that
explores the ramifications of making code immutable and stored in a database,
instead of a set of text files.
Unison supports a greatly simplified model for distributed
programming — one that describes the configuration of and communication between
programs in the same language as the programs themselves. Along the way, it
introduces a new approach to interfacing with programming languages, which is tailored to

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve come across two approaches to video synchronization.  The first, used by
a lot of the Xilinx IP I’ve come across, is to hold the video pipeline in
reset until everything is ready and then release the resets (in the right and
proper order) to get the design started.  If something goes wrong, however,
there’s no room for recovery.  The second approach is the approach I like to
use, which is to build video components that are inherently
“stable”: 1) if they
ever lose synchronization, they will naturally work their way back into
synchronization, and 2) once synchronized they will not get out of sync.
At least that’s the goal.  It’s a great goal, too–when it works.
Today’s story is about what happens when a “robust” video display isn’t.
