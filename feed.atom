   Developers: it’s time to start marking your calendars, we’re hard at work on a busy slate of summits coming your way in just a few weeks. Here’s a quick rundown of three summits we just announced this week:  
 
Android Dev Summit: October 27-28  
Chrome Dev Summit: November 3  
Firebase Summit: November 10 

Android Dev Summit is back, October 27-28
Directly from the team who builds Android, the Android Dev Summit returns this year on October 27-28. Join us to hear about the latest updates in Android development, centered on this year’s theme: excellent apps, across devices. We have over 30 sessions on a range of technical Android development topics. Plus, we’ve assembled the team that builds Android to get your burning #AskAndroid questions answered live. Interested in learning more? Be sure to sign up for updates through our Android newsletter here. 
Discover, Connect, Inspire at Chrome Dev Summit 2021
The countdown to Chrome Dev Summit 2021 is on — and we can’t wait to share what we have in store. We’ll kick things off on November 3 by sharing the latest product updates in our keynote and hosting a live ask me anything (AMA) with Chrome leaders. You’ll also have the chance to chat live with Googlers and developers around the world, participate in workshops with industry experts, attend interactive learning lounges to consult with engineers in a group setting, and receive personalized support during one-on-one office hours. Everyone can tune into the keynote and AMA, but space is limited for the workshops, office hours, and learning lounges. Request an invite to secure your spot — we’ll see you on November 3! 
And follow the Firebase Twitter channel for more updates on Firebase Summit, which will be coming to you on November 10!]]></summary>

been finding its way into recent mainline kernel releases; it is intended
to improve security by limiting the BPF programs that can be successfully
loaded into the kernel.  As John Fastabend described in his "Watching
the super powers" session at the 2021 Linux Plumbers Conference,
this new feature has the potential to completely break his tools.  But
rather than just complain, he decided to investigate solutions; the result
is an outline for an auditing mechanism that brings greater flexibility to
the problem of controlling which programs can be run.]]></summary>

Introduction
 Since its original launch in 2008, many of the core Google App Engine services such as Datastore, Memcache, and Blobstore, have matured to become their own standalone products: for example, Cloud Datastore, Cloud Memorystore, and Cloud Storage, respectively. The same is true for App Engine Task Queues with Cloud Tasks. Today's Module 7 episode of Serverless Migration Station reviews how App Engine push tasks work, by adding this feature to an existing App Engine ndb Flask app.

If we look at trendy companies that are within a couple factors of two in size of Twitter (in terms of either market cap or number of engineers), they mostly don't have similar expertise, often as a result of path dependence — because they "grew up" in the cloud, they didn't need kernel expertise to keep the lights on the way an on prem company does.

Introduction

Google Cloud offers three distinct ways of running your code or application in a serverless way, each serving different use cases. Google App Engine, our first Cloud product, was created to give users the ability to deploy source-based web applications or mobile backends directly to the cloud without the need of thinking about servers or scaling. Cloud Functions came later for scenarios where you may not have an entire app, great for one-off utility functions or event-driven microservices. Cloud Run is our latest fully-managed serverless product that gives developers the flexibility of containers along with the convenience of serverless. 
As all are serverless compute platforms, users recognize they share so…]]></summary>

내가 컴퓨터공학 학부 2학년을 다니던 2009년 즈음, 전공 2학년 때 배우는 객체지향 프로그래밍 시간에는 C++을 배웠었다. 서점에 갔는데, C/C++ 및 자료구조의 '열혈 프로그래밍' 시리즈로 유명한 윤성우님이 JAVA 프로그래밍 책을 출간하셨다. 놀랍게도 제목은 [난 정말 JAVA를 공부한 적이 없다구요]였다(이 책은 현재 '열혈 Java 프로그래밍'으로 개정되어 출간되었다). 그 당시 잠시 책을 살펴보긴 했지만, C++과는 코딩 스타일이 너무 다르다는 생각에 우선은 배우기를 보류했던 기억이 난다. 그런데 내가 졸업하고 몇 년 뒤부터는 학부과정 수업이 JAVA로 바뀌었다는 소식을 전해 들었다. 결과적으로 나는 JAVA를 배운 적이 없었다.
학교를 졸업하고 군대에 가서 프로그래밍을 할 일이 많았는데, 물론 대다수의 공공기관은 전자정부 표준프레임워크 사용에 따라 JAVA를 사용할 일이 많았다. 하지만 난 여전히 C/C++을 선호하던 관성을 따르고 싶었기에 꼭 필요한 경우가 아니면 JAVA를 회피했다. 현재의 나는 주로 Python을 사용하고 golang도 배우고 있지만 이상하게도 아직까지 굳이 JAVA를 직접적으로 사용할 일은 극히 드문 상황이다. 어쩌면 내가 의도적으로 피했기 때문은 아닐까 하는 생각도 들었다. 다른 프로그래밍 언어를 알고 있으므로, 남이 작성한 자바 코드를 보고 어느 정도 읽고 이해하고 약간 수정할 줄은 알지만, 굳이 JAVA를 사용하여 프로그램을 만들고 싶은 적은 없었던 것이다.

kernel subsystem maintainers; it is concerned mostly with process-oriented
issues that are not easily worked out on the mailing lists.  There was no
maintainers summit in 2020; plans had been made to hold it in an electronic
form, but there turned out to be a lack of things to talk about.  In 2021,
though, a number of interesting topics turned up, so an online gathering
was held on September 24 as part of the Linux Plumbers Conference.

lengthy missive from Lennart Poettering taking Linux distributors to
task for inadequately protecting systems from physical attacks.


	So, does the scheme so far implemented by generic Linux
	distributions protect us against the latter two scenarios?
	Unfortunately not at all. Because distributions set up disk
	encryption the way they do, and only bind it to a user password, an
	attacker can easily duplicate the disk, and then attempt to brute
	force your password. What's worse: since code authentication ends
	at the kernel — and the initrd is not authenticated anymore —,
	backdooring is trivially easy: an attacker can change the initrd
	any way they want, without having to fight any kind of protections.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over at the Guix-HPC blog, Ludovic Courtès writes about trying to package the PyTorch machine-learning library for the Guix distribution.  Building from source in a user-verifiable manner is part of the philosophy behind Guix, but there were a number of problems that were encountered:

The first surprise when starting packaging PyTorch is that, despite being on PyPI, PyTorch is first and foremost a large C++ code base. It does have a setup.py as commonly found in pure Python packages, but that file delegates the bulk of the work to CMake.

The second surprise is that PyTorch bundles (or "vendors", as some would say) source code for no less than 41 dependencies, ranging from small Python and C++ helper libraries to large C++ neural network tools. Like other distributions such as Debian, Guix avoids bundling: we would rather have one Guix package for each of these dependencies. The rationale is manifold, but it boils down to keeping things auditable, reducing resource usage, and making security updates practical.]]></summary>

Plumbers Conference would be focused rather differently.  But, as we reported earlier in September, his folio patch set ran into some, perhaps
unexpected, opposition and, ultimately, did not land in the mainline for

Yara Elkady, Google Developer Student Club (GDSC) Lead, can trace her passion for tech all the way back to a single moment. She was sitting in computer class when her middle school teacher posed a question to the class: 

“Did you know that you can create apps and games like the ones that you spend so much time on?”

It was a simple question, but it was enough to plant the seed that would define the trajectory of Yara’s career. Following in the footsteps of so many beginners before her, Yara did a Google search to find out more about creating apps. She didn’t realize it at the time, but Yara had just taken her first steps down the path to becoming a developer. 
Knowing that she wanted to pursue tech further, Yara went to c…]]></summary>

unfortunately in many ways, a big part of today's internet.  While middleboxes
inhabit the same physical niche as routers, they are not aimed at packet forwarding;
instead they are meant to monitor and manipulate the packets that they
see.  The effects of those devices on users of the networks they reign over may be
unfortunate as well, but the rest of the internet is only affected when
trying to communicate with those users—or so it was thought.  Based on some
recently reported research, it turns out that middleboxes can be abused to 
inflict denial-of-service (DoS) attacks elsewhere on the net.]]></summary>

testing.


So I've spent a fair amount of this week trying to sort out all the
odd warnings, and I want to particularly thank Guenter Roeck for his
work on tracking where the build failures due to -Werror come from.

Is it done? No. But on the whole I'm feeling fairly good about this
all, even if it has meant that I've been looking at some really odd
and grotty code. Who knew I'd still worry about some odd EISA driver
on alpha, after all these years? A slight change of pace ;)]]></summary>

at the difficulties caused by the OpenSSL 3 transition in the

	For distributions, however, the story is different:
	cryptography moved to using Rust, because they wanted to
	leverage all of the static analysis capabilities built into the
	language.  This, too, is a reasonable decision, from a development
	perspective.  From the ecosystem perspective, however, it is
	problematic, as the Rust ecosystem is still rapidly evolving, and
	so we cannot support a single branch of the Rust compiler for an
	entire 2 year lifecycle, which means it exists in community.  Our
	solution, historically, has been to hold cryptography at
	the latest version that did not require Rust to build.  However,
	that version is not compatible with OpenSSL 3, and so it will
	eventually need to be upgraded to a new version which is.  And so,

oddities in Python's handling of Not a Number (NaN) values in

Years ago, OpenBSD gained two new security system calls, pledge(2)
(originally tame(2)) and unveil. In both, an application
surrenders capabilities at run-time. The idea is to perform initialization
like usual, then drop capabilities before handling untrusted input,
limiting unwanted side effects. This feature is applicable even where type
safety isn’t an issue, such as Python, where a program might still get
tricked into accessing sensitive files or making network connections when
it shouldn’t. So how can a Python program access these system calls?
As discussed previously, it’s quite easy to access C APIs from
Python through its ctypes package, and this is no exception.

repeats. The UFOpaedia page on the topic gives the word lists: 53
adjectives and 76 nouns, for a total of 4028 possible code names. A
typical game has around 60 missions, and if code names are generated
naively on the fly, then per the birthday paradox around half of all games
will see a repeated mission code name! Fortunately this is easy to avoid,
and the particular configuration here lends itself to an interesting
implementation.

How the idea emerged
With the advancement of technology, drones have become not only smaller, but also have more compute. There are many examples of iPhone-sized quadcopters in the consumer drone market and the computing power to do live tracking while recording 4K video. However, the most important element has not changed much - the controller. It is still bulky and not intuitive for beginners to use. There is a smartphone with on-display control as an option; however, the control principle is still the same.

SPDX has been used in the kernel and other projects to identify the licenses and attach other metadata to  software components.

Between eighty and ninety percent (80%-90%) of a modern application is assembled from open source software components. An SBOM [software bill of materials] accounts for the software components contained in an application — open source, proprietary, or third-party — and details their provenance, license, and security attributes. SBOMs are used as a part of a foundational practice to track and trace components across software supply chains. SBOMs also help to proactively identify software issues and risks and establish a starting point for their remediation.

SPDX results from ten years of collaboration from representatives across industries, including the leading Software Composition Analysis (SCA) vendors – making it the most robust, mature, and adopted SBOM standard.]]></summary>

	Freeing the art of systems programming from the grips of C/C++

	rewriting everything is not the answer. In the Zig project we’re
	making the C/C++ ecosystem more fun and productive. Today we have a
	compiler, a linker and a build system, and soon we’ll also have a
	package manager, making Zig a complete toolchain that can fetch

	target.

library, but the "rules" in the PEP have been applied in settings and tools well outside of that

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amateur ("ham") radio operators have been experimenting with ways to use
computers in their hobby since PCs became widely available—perhaps even
before then. While many
people picture hams either talking into a microphone or tapping a telegraph
key, many hams now type on a keyboard or even click buttons on a computer screen to make
contacts.  Even hams who still prefer to talk or use Morse code may still
use computers for some things, such as logging contacts or predicting
radio conditions. While most hams use Windows, there is no shortage of ham
radio software for Linux.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Version 3.0 of the OpenSSL TLS library has been released; the large
version-number jump (from 1.1.1) reflects a new versioning scheme.


	Most applications that worked with OpenSSL 1.1.1 will still work
	unchanged and will simply need to be recompiled (although you may
	see numerous compilation warnings about using deprecated
	APIs). Some applications may need to make changes to compile and
	work correctly, and many applications will need to be changed to
	avoid the deprecations warnings. We have put together a migration 
	guide to describe the major differences in OpenSSL 3.0 compared to
	previous releases.


OpenSSL has also been relicensed to Apache 2.0, which should end the era of
"special exceptions" needed to use OpenSSL in GPL-licensed applications.

blog entry and the changelog for

often limited the speed of the system as a whole.  A great deal of effort
went into carefully ordering requests to get the best performance out of
the storage device; achieving that goal was well worth expending some CPU
time.  But then storage devices got much faster and the equation changed.
Fancy I/O-scheduling mechanisms have fallen by the wayside and effort is now
focused on optimizing code so that the CPU can keep up with its storage.  A
block-layer change that was merged for the 5.15 kernel shows the kinds of
tradeoffs that must be made to get the best performance from current hardware.]]></summary>

We received thousands of applications from developers across the world and we were truly amazed by the response. We’re impressed by the innovation and passion of the indie game community, and the unique and creative games they bring to players worldwide.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On the ADA Logics blog, David Korczynski and Adam Korczynski write about their work integrating 115 open-source projects with Google's OSS-Fuzz project for doing continuous fuzz testing.    They describe the process of integrating a project into OSS-Fuzz, and discuss their findings, which include more than 2000 bugs (500+ security relevant), of which 1300+ have been fixed at this point:

Throughout the process we integrated projects written in C, C++, Python, Go and Rust and the types of bugs we found across the projects are a reflection of the language the project was written in. Typically, for managed languages the bugs are within the umbrella term of uncaught exceptions and denial of service bugs, whereas in native languages the bugs are mostly split between assert violations, NULL-dereferences, heap-out-of-bounds, stack-out-of-bounds, stack overflows, integer arithmetic, memory leaks, out-of-memory and timeout bugs.]]></summary>

keybindings) against those who argue for changes to make Emacs more
approachable (and aesthetically pleasing) to newcomers.  Those discussions
tend toward mega-thread status, so it should be no surprise that a query
about possibly moving Emacs development to a "forge" (e.g. GitHub or GitLab) got
similar treatment.  As always in Emacs-land, there are multiple facets to
the discussion, including the desirability of moving away from an
email-based workflow, accommodating younger, forge-centric developers

installation mechanisms (primarily pip, but there are others) looks
on its way to being resolved—or at least regularized.  PEP 668
("Graceful cooperation between external and Python package
managers") has been created to provide ways for the two types of package installation
to
work together, rather than at cross-purposes at times.
Since many operating systems depend on Python tools, with package versions
that may differ from those of users' Python applications, making them play together
nicely should result in more stable systems.]]></summary>

summary.  It is worth mentioning, though, that the realtime preemption
locking code has been pulled into the
mainline with little fanfare.  This 
work began in 2004 and has fundamentally
changed many parts of the core kernel.  With this pull, the sleepable locks
that make deterministic realtime response possible have finally joined all
of that other work (though the kernel must be built with the
REALTIME configuration option to use them).

Congratulations are due to all of the realtime developers who pushed this
project forward for nearly two decades.]]></summary>
