"silent" errors that don't print any messages to the console.
Other attendees were less convinced that this was a problem, but his presentation
sparked a lot of discussion about whether the Rust-for-Linux project could
improve error handling in kernel Rust code.]]></summary>

In addition to the ScatterPlot provided with the developer preview release in July, you can now make use of a Gantt chart to explore trace details. This is a great enhancement, as we are driven by the mission to provide Red Hat OpenShift users with an "observability as one" experience (see Figure 1), allowing you to easily analyze metrics, alerts, logs, network traffic, and now traces under one console.

nearing the release of RPM 4.20, the last major planned update for the RPM 4.x

Until this release, Loki was required to be deployed alongside Network Observability to store the network flows data. 
In this article, let's look at some of the advantages and trade-offs users would have when deploying the Network Observability Operator with Loki disabled. As more metrics are enabled by default with this feature, we'll also demonstrate a use case on how those metrics can benefit users for real world scenarios.

With the LSP4IJ project now established and increasingly integrated into other IntelliJ plugins, we can shift our focus back to enhancing our Quarkus support. This support offers consistent features across both VS Code and IntelliJ, thanks to the MicroProfile language server augmented with Quarkus-specific capabilities and Qute language servers.

The bindings are called wxPython. Why I like wxPython?
I find Tkinter too basic, Qt needing too much boilerplate code, and GTK (PyGobject)
too fiddly to set up on Windows (maybe it has since improved). While getting wxPython is as easy as
pip install wxPython on all platforms.
Most applications run some kind of background tasks. If the whole application was single threaded
the GUI would freeze until the background tasks complete so a common technique is to have separate
threads for the GUI and the "backend". Multithreading naturally leads to the issue of synchronization.
For example you should not destroy a button from one thread when it is being repainted by another thread.]]></summary>

As long as it can gather enough entropy, it produces secure random numbers.



Since the significant structural changes in Linux 4 and Linux 5.17, there has
been no research on the provable security of Linux-DRBG. For the first time (to
the best of our knowledge), we formally model the Linux-DRBG in Linux 6.4.8
and prove its security in the seedless robustness model

The Network Observability CLI (oc netobserv) is a lightweight flow and packet visualization tool. It deploys a NetObserv eBPF agent and flowlogs-pipeline on your Kubernetes cluster to collect flows or packets from nodes network interfaces and streams data to a single collector for analysis and visualization. This first version of the tool allows users to capture flows or packets running a simple command. It reuses the NetObserv components without the need to install and configure operator(s).

You may have noticed a recent boom in AI-assisted content generation as well, with increasingly convincing degrees of expertise on a wide range of topics.
However, you also may have encountered limitations in the knowledge or accuracy of LLMs. Some very specific or esoteric knowledge that a model was not privy to in its data set during training could be missing or downright incorrect. Also, depending on when the model completed its training, a given LLM may not be up to date on current events.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This summer I participated in GSoC under the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure. The goal of the project was to improve the NewGVN pass so that it can replace GVN as the main value numbering pass in LLVM.
Background
Global Value Numbering (GVN) consists of assigning value numbers such that instructions with the same value number are equivalent. NewGVN was introduced in 2016 to replace GVN. We now highlight a few aspects in which NewGVN is better than GVN.
A key advantage of NewGVN over GVN is that it is complete for loops, while GVN is only complete for acyclical code. NewGVN is complete for loops because when it first processes loops, it assumes that only the first iteration will be executed, later corroborating these assumptions—this is known as the optimistic assumption. In practice, the opti…]]></summary>

Tech Fund (STF) has agreed to invest €688,800
to improve the security, stability, and functionality of Samba. The investment will take
place over three years and will be managed by SerNet, a company that
employs several Samba core developers and offers support for
Samba. According to its announcement,
work has already begun and is expected to complete in 2026:


The project's focus is on areas like transparent failover, SMB3 UNIX
extensions, and modern security protocols such as SMB over QUIC. These
improvements are designed to ensure that Samba remains a robust and
secure solution for organizations that rely on a sovereign IT
infrastructure that is as independent as possible of proprietary
software regimes, but including optimal interoperability.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The release of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (JBoss EAP) 8 brought an important change on how the server is kept up to date. In essence, in the previous major version of the Java application server, updates were provided as a series of modifications that were applied by a capability embedded into the server itself. 
Now, in JBoss EAP version 8, updates are performed  by a separate dedicated tool: the JBoss Installation Manager. Of course, this has an impact on how to manage the automation around JBoss EAP and especially how to handle upgrading, using Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform, from version 7 to 8.
A bit of context first

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the years, the GNU C library (glibc) has collected library of helper functions in its upstream source tree, for writing in-tree glibc tests that run as part of its test suite. Like the test suite itself, this part of glibc is not installed, and is not available for general application development. This means that test development usually has to happen within the glibc source tree, which poses some challenges. However, there is an alternative, the glibc-support repository, which allows out-of-tree development of glibc test cases. Often, this simplifies development of test cases (particularly debugging), allows quicker iteration, and more efficient test case creation. Test cases produced this way can be integrated easily into the upstream test suite.

Background
The ClangIR project aims to establish a new IR for Clang, built on top of MLIR. As part of the ongoing effort to support heterogeneous programming models, this project focuses on integrating OpenCL C language support into ClangIR. The ultimate goal is to enable the compilation of GPU kernels written in OpenCL C into LLVM IR targeting the SPIR-V architecture, laying the groundwork for future enhancements in SYCL and CUDA support.
What We Did
Our work involved several key areas:

Python 3.13.0RC2
Final opportunity to test and find any show-stopper bugs before we bless and release 3.13.0 final on October 1st.
Get it here: Python Release Python 3.13.0rc2 | Python.org
Call to action
We strongly encourage maintainers of third-party Python projects to 
prepare their projects for 3.13 compatibilities during this phase, and 
where necessary publish Python 3.13 wheels on PyPI to be ready for the 
final release of 3.13.0. Any binary wheels built against Python 
3.13.0rc2 will work with future versions of Python 3.13. As always, 
report any issues to the Python bug tracker.
Please keep in mind that this is a preview release and while it’s as close to the final release as we can get it, its use is not recommended for production environments.

Reviewer time is precious, so any tool that can lighten the load is worth exploring.
That is why Jesse Brandeburg and Kamel Ayari decided to test whether
tools like ChatGPT could review patches to provide quick feedback to
contributors about common problems. In a
talk at the Netdev 0x18 conference this July, Brandeburg provided an overview of an
experiment using machine learning to review emails containing patches
sent to the netdev
mailing list. Large-language models (LLMs) will not be replacing human reviewers anytime
soon, but they may be a useful addition to help humans focus on deeper
reviews instead of simple rule violations.]]></summary>

(though it had its roots in earlier work, of course).  It is fair to say
that finishing that job has taken a bit longer than anybody involved would
have expected.  Now, though, Sebastian Andrzej Siewior has posted a brief
patch series making it possible to enable realtime preemption in the
mainline kernel on three architectures.


	With the printk bits merged, PREEMPT_RT could be enabled on X86,
	ARM64 and Risc-V. These three architectures merged required changes

	changes in the queue that would affect them.

First, I'll introduce the concepts of the inner and outer loop in simple English, and then explain the use of specific products for realization of the platform engineer’s tasks within this cycle.
From DevOps to platform engineering
Since people started writing software, there has always been a divide between those who create and those who maintain. In the old days (and I’m old, so bear with me), teams were small and the job of maintaining the software in "production" was often part of the developer’s role. However, as software solutions truly took off, the scale became too large for the devs, and the sys admins who were …]]></summary>

The problem
Modern storage evolved to keep pace with growing numbers of CPUs by providing multiple queues through which I/O requests can be submitted. This allows CPUs to submit I/O requests and handle completion interrupts locally. The result is good performance and scalability on machines with many CPUs.
Although virtio-blk devices in KVM guests have multiple queues by default, they do not take advantage of multi-queue on the host. I/O requests from all queues are processed in a single thread on the host for guests with the <driver io=native …> libvirt domain XML setting. This single thread can become a bottleneck for I/O bou…]]></summary>

it’s mainly a C++ implementation — and you need regular expressions. You

resourceful engineer, using an asset already in hand seems prudent. But
it’s a C++ interface, and you’re using C instead of C++ for a reason,
perhaps to avoid dealing with C++. Have no worries. This article is
about wrapping std::regex in a tidy C interface which not only
hides all the C++ machinery, but utterly tames it. It’s not so much
practical as a potpourri of interesting techniques.

Generally, you may want to scale test to reach a certain max density as the end goal, but it is often also useful to scale up from smaller batch sizes to observe how performance may change as the overall cluster becomes more loaded. Those of us that work in the area of performance analysis know there are many ways to measure a workload and standardizing on a tool can help provide more comparable results across different configurations and environments.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cycle Time is a measure of how long it takes to get a new feature in a
  software system from idea to running in production. In Agile circles, we try
  to minimize cycle time. We do this by defining and implementing very small
  features and minimizing delays in the development process. Although the rough
  notion of cycle time, and the importance of reducing it, is common, there is a
  lot of variations on how cycle time is measured.


A key characteristic of agile software development is a shift from a
  Waterfall Process, where work is decomposed based on
  activity (analysis, coding, testing) to an Iterative Process where work is
  based on a subset of functionality (simple pricing, bulk discount,
  valued-customer discount). Doing this generates a feedback loop where we can learn

	For the wayfinders the process of interacting with maintainers is
	frustrating and slow, and they don't enjoy it as much as

	end, when a maintainer gets into the details of their particular
	intersection they don't want to do anything but go stay in their
	hotel.

It is a branch of philosophy dealing with what is morally right or wrong, which is then applied to various areas of knowledge, such as engineering. Ethics supports pillars such as integrity, responsibility, objectivity, fairness, confidentiality, honesty, and veracity.
As intelligent systems exert increasing influence over critical decisions across multiple domains, the need for transparency and fairness is paramount. The application of ethical principles to artificial intelligence (AI) becomes essential, as it protects against discrimination and guarantees the explainability of decisions, thus promoting the construction of a more inclusive, reliable, and socially r…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is the final installment of our 4-part series on GPU programming. Catch up on the previous articles:

What is GPU programming

Your first GPU algorithm: Scan/prefix sum

Your second GPU algorithm: Quicksort

With those topics covered, we can now move on to the subject of this article: how to choose a GPU framework/library.
How to choose a GPU framework
Generally, when you’re benchmarking some GPU code, you want to make sure to do the following:

Run the algorithm more than once, and get the median/quartiles, or mean/stdev of each of the running times.
Synchronize your CUDA kernels, to make sure the program has fully finished executing—by default CUDA will launch kernels asynchronously (in the background) so that the host can continue processing things.

The complaints were basically due to the complexity of implementing all the components necessary to deal with standards such as Saga, for example.
It is important to note that it is not the purpose of this article to make a comparison between distributed transaction handling models, especially the Saga pattern. Likewise, this article should not be taken as a criticism of the Saga pattern or the non-recommendation of its adoption.

published the final form of its new post-quantum cryptographic standards. One
key-exchange mechanism and two digital-signature schemes are now officially

In OpenShift, we can make use of the built-in Build, BuildConfig, and Build Strategies (Understanding Image Builds, Understanding BuildConfigs) objects to build container images on cluster nodes.
In a multi-arch compute cluster we can target nodes of a specific architecture with these build objects, and collect these architecture-specific container images into manifest lists of built images that can run anywhere in the cluster.

in Busan, South Korea, Holger Levsen provided a history lesson on the
"first 11 years" of the Reproducible Builds project.
He has been involved in the project for most of that time and has been a
Debian user since the mid-1990s, contributor since 2001, and a Debian
member since 2007; "I love Debian".  Meanwhile, his aim is to make all free
software be reproducible, so that anyone can check that a binary program

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The 

Forgejo project has announced that, starting from version 9.0, Forgejo will be released under the GPLv3 license (or a later version). Older versions of the software forge remain MIT-licensed.



A copyleft license makes reusing other copyleft software easier. Recently, we discovered that 

some of the dependencies we used were incompatible with the license Forgejo was distributed with, and they had to be removed for now. Choosing copyleft licenses enables us to reuse more work, and saves us precious time to focus on improving Forgejo itself.]]></summary>
