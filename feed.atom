For example, you might use  golang.org/x/text/cmd/gotext in conjunction with go:generate to generate message catalogs for translation, or honnef.co/go/tools/cmd/staticcheck to perform static analysis on your code before committing a change.
This raises a couple of interesting questions — especially in a team environment. How do you make sure that everyone has the necessary tools installed on their machines? And that the tools they are using are all the same version?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To adapt to cloud-native trends, developers must have multiple perspectives on their distributed systems. In particular, they need to understand how their code will smoothly integrate with infrastructure configurations. As the complexity of a microservices architecture evolves, traffic load and cluster use both also increase, which influences development practices at the team level.
In my Red Had Summit 2022 session Efficient resource management with Red Hat OpenShift, you'll discover some best practices and valuable settings to manage application resources in a Red Hat OpenShift cluster. The OpenShift web console can help you monitor workloads, offering both holistic and individual views of deployments, which can guide future application improvements.
We'll start working locally by looking at a Quarkus application with a certain complexity, deploying it to the Red Hat OpenShift Sandbox, and following its behavior under increasing workloads. Next, we will change the pod's CPU and RAM using application configurations by observing metrics within the OpenShift web console. Moreover, we will discuss Kubernetes/OpenShift resources that can protect critical workloads and use Java-based tests to validate those before their actual deployment.
Finally, we'll cover a few essential aspects of sustainable cluster governance that can help teams have a healthier development process.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kubernetes significantly impacts a developer's daily life—and not just for inner loop development such as writing code, compiling, and testing microservices locally. It also drives developers to consider how outer loop development, such as integration testing, continuous deployment, and security, are affected when the applications are containerized to run on Kubernetes.
Of course, you can find a variety of open source tools to improve the developer experience and help solve those challenges. Ironically, however, adopting a new tool can add another concern for developers, since they tend to try to find a way to make a function or feature work with their own tools or development frameworks—even though it sometimes takes time and effort for them to realize that there’s no such thing in their current toolbox.
What if a developer could skip boring but necessary tasks using out-of-box features in the development framework? For example, wouldn't it be great if you didn't need to create Dockerfiles for application containerization, or if you could debug remote code inside pods, or if your framework could perform automated tests when code changes?
Watch my Red Hat Summit 2022 session, Improving developer experience and process from local to Kubernetes. You’ll learn how enterprise developers can improve their development productivity using remote development, remote debugging, live coding, and continuous testing from the developer's local environment to a remote Kubernetes cluster—all without additional CI/CD tool integration.

When logging into Cryostat on OpenShift, you will be redirected to the OpenShift login page and prompted to enter the username and password corresponding to your OpenShift user account. Upon success, you can stay logged in during multiple sessions—for 24 hours by default.

Negative dentries reflect failed file-name lookups, which are then cached,
saving an expensive operation if the file name in question is looked up
again.  There is no mechanism to proactively prune back those cache
entries, however, so the cache keeps growing until memory pressure finally

For last month’s digest, see Kafka Monthly Digest: March 2022.
Releases
There are currently two releases in progress, 3.2.0 and 3.1.1.
3.2.0
The release process for 3.2.0 continued this month. Bruno Cadonna published the first release candidate, RC0, on April 15. However, a few issues were quickly identified: KAFKA-12841, PR-12102, and KAFKA-13794. A new release candidate should be available in the next few days. For more details, you can find the release plan on the Kafka wiki.
3.1.1
Tom Bentley published 3.1.1 RC0 on April 8. The community decided to include the fix for KAFKA-13794; RC1 was published on April 29, and the vote is currently ongoing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The perils of using the Unsafe class in Java applications are well documented. Although Unsafe has historically offered access to low-level programming features, it exposes internal details of the implementation and its use is therefore highly discouraged. If you submit code that uses the Unsafe API to the GraalVM Native Image compiler, you can encounter even more problems that don't exist on dynamic JVMs such as HotSpot.
This article looks at the issues that GraalVM Native Image can potentially introduce with Unsafe, and offers coding techniques that can help you achieve some of the goals you might want to use Unsafe for. Among other things, we'll look at the VarHandles API, which was introduced in the JDK as an alternative to some of the Unsafe APIs.

May 2022 Updates: added notes about C++20 and constexpr algorithms, updated the benchmark and compared against std::ranges::search and custom strchr versions.



     
    


The naive approach of finding a pattern in a string is O(nm) (where n is the length of the whole string, m is the length of the pattern). There are much better alternatives. For instance, Boyer-Moore with the linear complexity.
The algorithm is, for example, used in grep - see this reference - why GNU grep is fast,

protocol?
The following summarizes my basic answer.
First off, don’t start with Xilinx’s example designs.  Sorry, but their
examples are horribly broken.  Even their demo AXI Stream master is
broken.  It’s a shame
that they’ve neither fixed these designs, nor updated their training materials
to acknowledge that their basic designs are broken.
Fig. 1, Basic Roadmap for Learning AXI



Others have suggested that the best place to start is by learning handshaking,
and most of the AXI stream protocol is just that: handshaking.  I would agree.
Therefore, I would recommend that anyone starting out begin by learning
AXI’s handshaking rules.
As that article will
explain, the AXI stream protocol is little more than simple handsh…]]></summary>

This release deprecates support for the STABS debugging format and
introduces support for the CTF debugging format.  The C and C++
frontends continue to advance with extending support for features
in the upcoming C2X and C++23 standards and the C++ standard library
improves support for the experimental C++20 and C++23 parts.
The Fortran frontend now fully supports TS 29113 for interoperability with C.
[...] On the security side GCC can now initialize stack variables implicitly
using -ftrivial-auto-var-init to help tracking down and mitigating
uninitialized stack variable flaws.  The C and C++ frontends now support
__builtin_dynamic_object_size compatible with the clang extension.
The x86 backend gained mitigations against straight line speculation
with -mharden-sls.  The experimental Static Analyzer gained uninitialized
variable use detection and many other improvements.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this article, you'll learn about user and group authorization through LDAP to an Apache Kafka cluster. For a Kafka broker, user- and group-based authorization are handled by Access Control Lists  (ACLs). More fine-grained approaches to user and group authorization on Kafka cluster resources also use single sign-on (SSO). This article combines LDAP with Red Hat's single sign-on technology, which can write Kafka ACL rules.
This use case applies to teams that are currently employing common identity management services (IdMs) such as Active Directory (AD) or LDAP. We demonstrate how to synchronize users and groups from an IdM into Red Hat's SSO. We then show how to create ACL rules in Red Hat's SSO to apply authorization rules and policies to Kafka. This procedure allows our Kafka cluster t…]]></summary>

Similarly, some applications put a premium on durability, whereas others care more about availability. This article introduces a way of thinking about the tradeoffs and how to design your message flows using a model I call the Kafka optimization theorem.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The classic NUMA architecture is built around nodes, each of which contains
a set of CPUs and some local memory; all nodes are more-or-less equal.
Recently, though, "tiered-memory" NUMA systems have begun to appear; these
include CPU-less nodes that contain persistent memory rather than (faster,
but more expensive) DRAM.   One possible use for that
memory is to hold less-frequently-used pages rather than forcing them out
to a backing-store device.  There is an interesting problem that emerges
from this use case, though: how does the kernel manage the movement of
pages between faster and slower memory?  Several recent patch sets have
taken differing approaches to the problem of rebalancing memory on these
systems.]]></summary>

Perhaps you’ve wondered, “If only I could compute check digits three times
faster using the same hardware!” Me neither. But if that ever happens
someday, then this article is for you. I will show how to compute the
Luhn algorithm in parallel using SIMD within a register, or
SWAR.
If you want to skip ahead, here’s the full source, tests, and benchmark:
luhn.c
The Luhn algorithm isn’t just for credit card numbers, but they do make a
nice target for a SWAR approach. The major payment processors use 16
digit numbers — i.e. 16 ASCII bytes — and typical machines today have
8-byte registers, so the input fits into two machine registers. In this
context, the algorithm works like so:

Noto emoji, a new black and white emoji font with less color, may gain us more in the long run
Posted by Jennifer Daniel, Creative Director - Emoji & Expression
         
In 1999 — back when Snake 🐍  was the best thing about your phone 📱 — there were three phone carriers in Japan 🗾 . On these phones were tiny, beautiful pictures called emoji (meaning “picture” and “character”  in Japanese 🥰). These 176 images were very simple — think 8-bit tech — and as a result were exquisitely abstract and tremendously useful when texting ✨ Twenty years later 👶🕛🕐🕑🕒🕓🕔🕕🕖🕗🕘🕙🕚🧓, emoji are a global phenomenon 🌎.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TechRepublic has published an
interview with Fedora project leader Matthew Miller.


	Basically, every modern language provides a lot of building blocks
	that usually come from other smaller open-source projects. These
	are libraries, and they do things like format text, handle images,
	connect to databases and deal with talking across the
	internet. Projects like Fedora or Debian used to work to try to
	package up every such library in our own format, made to work
	nicely with everything else.

	Now, every new language — Rust, for example — comes with its own
	tools to manage these, and they don’t work nicely together with our
	old way. The sheer scale is overwhelming — for Rust alone, as I
	checked just now there are 81,541 such libraries. We can’t keep up
	with repackaging all of that into our own format, let alone that
	plus all of the other languages. We need to approach this
	differently in order to still provide a good solution to software
	developers.

	I think a lot of that will need machine learning and automation …
	we’ll need to keep adjusting so we can provide the value that Linux
	distributions give users in trust, security and coherent
	integration at an exponential scale.]]></summary>

 Introduction
  
Recently, we discussed containerizing App Engine apps for Cloud Run, with or without Docker. But what about Cloud Functions… can App Engine users take advantage of that platform somehow? Back in the day, App Engine was always the right decision, because it was the only option. With Cloud Functions and Cloud Run joining in the serverless product suite, that's no longer the case. 
Back when App Engine was the only choice, it was selected to host small, single-function apps. Yes, when it was the only option. Other developers have created huge monolithic apps for App Engine as well… because it was also the only option.

Red Hat's SSO sources user information from a federated user database, or user federation, and it provides the option to configure the Kerberos protocol for this purpose.
In this article, you'll see how to set up Red Hat's SSO to authenticate users using the standard Kerberos protocol along with the Simple and Protected GSS_API Negotiation Mechanism (SPNEGO) specification.
To use Kerberos, Red Hat's SSO must set up an identity called a service principal. The user gains access to Red Hat's SSO through Kerberos in a two-step process: first they obtain a Ticket Granting Ti…]]></summary>

normally just inspecting such a repository is considered to be safe.  As a
recent posting to the Git mailing list shows, however, there are still
risks lurking inside these repositories; code that lives in them can be
triggered in unexpected ways.  In particular, malicious "bare" repositories
can be added as a subdirectory of a repository; they can be configured to run
code whenever Git commands are executed there, which is something that can
happen in surprising ways. There is now an effort
underway to try to address the problem in Git, without breaking the

Although your cluster's own integrity is secure in that environment, communicating safely outside the cluster requires considerable setup. In this article, you'll learn how to connect securely through a firewall to the internet while keeping your cluster in a private workspace. We use Amazon's Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), Security Token Service (STS), and AWS Transit Gateway to effect secure connections.
Note: To follow along with this article, you should be familiar with the AWS command-line interface (CLI), and have a basic understanding of AWS networking, routing, AWS permissions, transit gateways, and OpenShift, as well as Linux shell commands.

Android-based LineageOS distribution has been released.


	With that said, we have been working extremely hard since Android
	12’s release last October to port our features to this new version
	of Android. Thanks to our hard work adapting to Google’s fairly
	large changes in Android 11, we were able to rebase our changes
	onto Android 12 much more efficiently. This led to a lot of time to
	spend on cool new features, as well as adapt our additions to
	Android 12’s new Material You design language!


Beyond the move to Android 12, this release includes improvements to a lot
of apps, a new setup wizard, and more.  Less happily, this release has had
to leave a lot of older devices behind; a device must be able to run a 4.9
or newer kernel to be able to run LineageOS 19.]]></summary>

These systems have their own compute capabilities and can natively run network functions with an accelerated data plane. The new model allows us to offload to accelerators not only the individual subroutines but whole software subsystems, such as networking or storage, with cloud-like security isolation and architectural compartmentalization.
One of the most prominent examples of this new architecture is the data processing unit (DPU). DPUs offer a complete compute system with an independent software stack, network identity, and provisioning capabilities.

	On a very positive note, while it might seem the negatives are

Like every major GCC release, this version will bring many additions, improvements, bug fixes, and new features. GCC 12 is already the system compiler in Fedora 36. GCC 12 will also be available on Red Hat Enterprise Linux in the Red Hat Developer Toolset (version 7) or the Red Hat GCC Toolset (version 8 and 9).
Like the article I wrote about GCC 10, this article describes only new features affecting C++.
We implemented several C++23 proposals in GCC 12. The default dialect in GCC 12 is -std=gnu++17; to enable C++23 features, use the -std=c++23 or -std=gnu++23 command-line options. (The latter option allows GNU extensions.)
Note that C++20 and C++23 features are still experimental in GCC 12.

Key observations for std::ranges algorithms:
Ranges algorithms are defined in the <algorithm> header, while the ranges infrastructure and core types are defined in the <ranges> header.
Usually, there are at least two overloads for range algorithms: with a pair of iterators and an overload with a single range argument.
The version that returns a subrange or an iterator and takes a range returns a borrowed range or a borrowed iterator. This helps detect iterators to temporary ranges.
The range versions take “projections,” which sometimes allows more flexib…]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-04-24T14:44:41.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[KISA에서는 [소프트웨어 개발 보안 가이드] 를 발간하고 있다. 이 가이드는 예전에 시큐어 코딩 가이드를 보다 소프트웨어공학 개발 프로세스 전체에 맞추어 확장한 것으로, 분석/설계 단계 보안강화 활동과 구현단계 시큐어코딩 가이드를 결합한 형태다.
또한, [소프트웨어 보안약점 진단가이드] 라는 문서도 있는데, 이는 위의 개발 보안 가이드의 내용에 추가적으로 실제 어떤 문제점이 존재하는지 여부를 찾는 관점에서 여러가지 추가 내용(잘못된 코드 사례, 잘못된 탐지, 바른 탐지 등)을 포함하고 있다. 
위 두 가이드는 [SW 보안약점 진단원] 이라는 자격증 시험을 대비할 때 필수적으로 숙지해야 할 문서이다. 


이와 별개로, 2022년 2월 25일, KISA에서 [Python 시큐어코딩 가이드]라는 문서를 처음 공개했다. 기존의 시큐어코딩 가이드는 주로 C/C++ 이나 JAVA 관련 프레임워크를 다루었는데, 파이썬 언어가 추가된 것이다.
실제로 문서내의 설명에 따르면, 파이썬 언어는 프로그래밍 언어의 순위를 공표하는 TIOBE 에서 1위를 차지하는 등 그 사용도가 매우 높기 때문에 파이썬 언어를 사용하는 서비스들도 보안 검증이 고려되어야 한다는 목적에서 추가한 것이라고 한다. 이 가이드는 Python 3.X 버전을 기준으로 한다.


그리고 원래 기존의 구현단계 보안약점 제거 기준은 총 49개인데, 그중 파이썬에 포함하기 극히 어려운 항목은 제외하여 42개 항목에 대해서만 가이드를 구성한 것 같다.


한가지 궁금한 점이, 기존의 보안약점 가이드는 대부분 웹 서비스를 염두하여 SQL 삽입이라던지 크로스사이트 스크립트(XSS)를 다루는 경우가 많은데 과연 파이썬 프로그래밍에서 이를 어떻게 적용할까? 생각을 했다.
가이드를 잘 살펴보니, 우선 파이썬도 맞고 웹 서비르를 염두한 것도 맞다. 즉, Django나 Flask 같은 파이썬용 웹 프레임웍? 패키지? 를 사용하는 것으로 가정하고 여기에서 안전하지 않은 코드와 안전한 코드를 구분하여 설명하는 방식으로 서술하고 있다.
그리고 암호화 관련된 내용에 대해서도 파이썬에 알맞은 PyCrypto 사용예를 들어 설명하고 있다. 특히 중요한 언급은 Python2 에서는 PyCrypto 기반이었지만, Python3부터는 PyCrypto를 개선한 PyCryptodomes를 사용해야 한다고 명시하고 있다. 실제로 어떤식으로 AES 암호화를 해야하는지 등의 예시도 보여주고 있다. 뿐만 아니라 난수 발생기 역시 os.urandom()이나, 그보다 좋은 secrets 등을 사용하여 강력한 난수를 생성하라고 권고하고 있다. 


전체적으로 보았을 때 그동안 파이썬 관련 보안 개발 표준이 거의 전무했는데, 최소한 국내에서 개발을 할 때에는 제시하면 좋을만한 KISA 가이드가 출시되서 좋은 것 같다. 실제로 내용도 최신 파이썬 버전이 잘 고려된 것 같다. 이 문서는 비록 다른 C/C++에 비해(최소 10년은 된듯??) 출범한지 얼마되지 않았으므로 아직 내용이나 분량이 앞으로 더 많이 늘어날 것으로 기대가 된다.
한편 올해 9월정도에 있을 것으로 예상되는 KISA SW보안약점 진단원 시험에서 파이썬 관련 내용도 다룰지는 아직 모르겠다..]]></summary>

In November 2019, Google Developer Group Pescara invited backend developer Filippo Tenaglia to speak at a local DevFest program, as part of the global developer event. The group turned the lights down and connected Filippo’s PC to the room’s speakers, and Filippo told attendees about his life as a visually impaired developer. He let them hear what he hears when he works with the code and let them hear the different speech synthesizers he uses: the one he uses to browse on the Internet, as well as the one that he uses to read source code, tha…]]></summary>

proprietary software vendors. Among them, Steinberg stands out as a company
that created some of the most-used software, including the Cubase and Nuendo digital audio
workstations. Steinberg is also known as the creator of the VST plugin API
that, largely due to its licensing policy, has irritated developers enough to
inspire multiple attempts at creating an open-source alternative. Even now,
when the VST3 SDK is available under the
GPLv3 license, the way the company exercises its control over the SDK
keeps pushing developers away toward other open-source solutions.

This is an introduction to open-source plugin
APIs for musicians and sound engineers alike. It focuses on the options in
the larger ecosystem and how their shortcomings led to the creation of new
alternatives with liberal licensing.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A proposal to "deprecate" support for BIOS-only systems for Fedora, by no longer
supporting new installations on those systems, led to a predictably long
discussion on the Fedora devel mailing list.  There are, it seems, quite a few
users who still have BIOS-based systems; many do not want to
have to switch away from Fedora simply to keep their systems up to date.
But, sometime in the future, getting rid of BIOS support seems inevitable since the
burden on those maintaining the tools for installing and booting
those systems is non-trivial and likely to grow over time.  To head
that off, a special interest group (SIG) may form to help keep BIOS support
alive until it really is no longer needed.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On his blog, Tom Tromey writes about speeding up the startup of the GDB debugger.  He sees 7x improvements in startup time (e.g. 2.2 to 0.3 seconds) for C++ code.

GDB, essentially, had two DWARF readers. They actually shared a surprisingly small amount of code (which was an occasional source of bugs). For example, while abbrev lookup and name generation (more on that later) was shared, the actual DIE [debugging information entry] data structures were not.

The first DWARF reader created “partial symbols”, which held a name and some associated, easy-to-compute data, like the kind of symbol (variable, function, struct tag, etc). The second DWARF reader (which is still there now) is called when more information was needed about a particular symbol — say, its type. This reader reads all the DIEs in a DWARF compilation unit and expands them into gdb’s symbol table, block, and type data structures.

Both of these scans were slow, but for the time being I’ve only rewritten the first scan, as it was the one that was first encountered and most obviously painful. (I’ve got a plan to fix up the CU expansion as well, but that’s a lengthy project of its own.)]]></summary>

Difficulties with PVs
In the early days of container-based development, each user had to ask an administrator to create a PV for that user's containers. Usually the administrator created 100 PVs in advance when the cluster was installed. The administrator also had to clean up the used PVs when they were released. Obviously, this process was inefficient and really burdensome.
Dynamic provisioning using StorageClass was developed to solve this problem. With StorageClass, you no longer have to manually manage your PVs—a provisioner manages them for you. …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An increasing number of Java applications run in containers. The exact number is hard to determine, because adoption of containers depends upon the market segment and cloud maturity of each particular team or company. However, some data is available—for example, data from New Relic suggests that over 62% of their customers' Java workloads run in containers. Like all data points, this one is an imperfect proxy for the market as a whole, but the report demonstrates that a significant subset of the Java market has already moved to container-based environments. Anecdotal data also tells us that this migration trend is far from over.
Teams using Java need to pay special attention to some aspects of container-based deployments and adopt a couple of best practices. This article focuses on the cho…]]></summary>

By container awareness, we mean that OpenJDK detects when it is running inside a container. In this article, you'll learn why container awareness is useful, what has changed recently in that area of OpenJDK, and what diagnostic options are available to help developers gain insight into how the JVM determines settings.
OpenJDK's container awareness detection uses Linux's control group (cgroup) filesystem to detect enforced resource quotas. As of this writing, Java 17 is the only long-term support release that supports both cgroups v1 and cgroups v2 configurations. Note, however, that there is currently work ongoing to backport cgroups v2 sup…]]></summary>

The post consists of  personal accounts from around two dozen contributors about the project, its history, and its community.

It’s been ten years today since the very first commit to what was already called Guix—the unimaginative name is a homage to Guile and Nix, which Guix started by blending together. On April 18th, 2012, there was very little to see and no actual "project". The project formed in the following months and became a collective adventure around a shared vision.

Ten years later, it’s amazing to see what more than 600 people achieved, with 94K commits, countless hours of translation, system administration, web design work, and no less than 175 blog posts to share our enthusiasm at each major milestone. It’s been quite a ride!]]></summary>

This attack exploits subtleties in text-encoding standards such as Unicode to produce source code whose tokens are logically encoded in a different order from the one in which they are displayed, leading to vulnerabilities that cannot be perceived directly by human code reviewers. 'Trojan Source' attacks, as we call them, pose an immediate threat both to first-party software and of supply-chain compromise across the industry. We present working examples of Trojan-Source attacks in C, C++, C#, JavaScript, Java, Rust, Go, and Python.

peril; SQL injection is a well-known technique for attacking applications
that stems from that, for example.  Generally, database frameworks and
libraries provide mechanisms that seek to lead programmers toward doing The
Right Thing, with parameterized queries and the like, but they cannot
enforce that—inventive developers will seemingly always find ways to inject
user input into places it should not go.  A recently adopted Python
Enhancement Proposal (PEP) provides a way to enforce the use of 
strings that are untainted by user input, but it uses the optional typing features
of the language to do so; those wanting to take advantage of it will need

This week, we launched the Apps Script connector for AppSheet, which now makes it possible to call Apps Script code functions from a no-code AppSheet app. This greatly extends the abilities of AppSheet apps by letting them access the power that Apps Script provides. For example, an AppSheet app can now use Apps Script to automate workflows with Google Workspace using the Workspace APIs for Drive, Docs, Sheets, and Admin SDK, and more – as well as other Google services like YouTube, Google Analytics, and BigQuery.

This GitHub blog

vulnerable.  The description in the announcement seems a bit
Windows-centric, but Linux multi-user systems are apparently vulnerable as well:

   On multi-user machines, Git users might find themselves
   unexpectedly in a Git worktree, e.g. when another user created a
   repository in `C:\.git`, in a mounted network drive or in a
   scratch space. Merely having a Git-aware prompt that runs `git
   status` (or `git diff`) and navigating to a directory which is

October 2020; the patch has been updated multiple times since then,
made its way into linux-next, and a pull
request was made by Mickaël Salaün for the 5.18 merge window.  But
it seems that there will be more to the story of getting this functionality
into the kernel, as Linus Torvalds declined to pull trusted_for(),
at least partly because he did not like the name, but there were other

	Some other languages, such as Perl, can track input and flag any

	outside source such as a web form. Flagging variables in this
	manner is called tainting. After a program runs the variable
	through a check, the variable can be untainted, a process called
	sanitization.

	Our GCC analyzer's taint mode is activated by

As a Red Hat employee, I work on GCC, the GNU Compiler Collection. Our static analyzer is still experimental but is making big strides in interesting areas, including a taint mode and an understanding of assembly-language code.

 

 
 

 
My work on adding static analysis has spanned the past three releases of GCC (versions 10, 11, and 12). The static analysis is enabled through the -fanalyzer option, and works together with several other options. This article describes what we've accomplished on static analysis in the upcoming major release of GCC, GCC 12, which is in feature-freeze and which I hope will …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This article explains the basics of observability for developers. We’ll look at why observability should interest you, its current level of maturity, and what to look out for to make the most of its potential.

The inception of the platform happened in June 2021 with the only objective of giving visibility to developers who have been creating and building projects relentlessly using Google technologies. But why the Dev Library? 
Why Dev Library?
  
Open-source communities are currently at a boom. The past 3 years have seen a surge of folks constantly building in public, talking about open-source contributions, digging into opportunities, and carving out a valuable portfolio for themselves. The idea behind the Dev Library as a whole was also to capture these open-source projects and leverage …]]></summary>
