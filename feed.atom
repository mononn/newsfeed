that can be rewarding even with the lack of any particular talent — a useful

available.  The time has come to combine work and pleasure and catch up

 In December, we announced that Google Play Games will be coming to PCs. As part of our broader goal to make our products and services work better together, this product strives to meet players where they are and give them access to their games on as many devices as possible. Today we're excited to announce that we’re opening sign-ups for Google Play Games as a beta in Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong.  
 
 Users participating in the beta can play a catalog of Google Play games on their Windows PC via a standalone application built by Google. We’re excited to announce that some of the most popular mobile games in the world will be available at launch, including Mobile Legends: Bang Bang, Summoners War, State of Survival: The Joker Collaboration, and Three Kingdoms Tactics, which delight hundreds of millions of players globally each month. 
 
 This product brings the best of Google Play to more laptops and desktops, enabling immersive and seamless gameplay sessions between a phone, tablet, Chromebook, and Windows PC. Players can easily browse, download, and play their favorite mobile games on their PCs, while taking advantage of larger screens with mouse and keyboard inputs. No more losing your progress or achievements when switching between devices, it just works with your Google Play Games profile! Play Points can also be earned for Google Play Games activity on PCs. 
 
   
We’re thrilled to expand our platform for players to enjoy their favorite Android games even more. To sign up for future announcements, or to access the beta in Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, please go to g.co/googleplaygames. If you’re an Android developer looking to learn more about Google Play Games, please express interest on our developer site. We’ll have more to share on future beta releases and regional availability soon.

audio and video toolkit has been released.


	For this long-overdue release, a major effort underwent to remove
	the old encode/decode APIs and replace them with an N:M-based API,
	the entire libavresample library was removed, libswscale has a new,
	easier to use AVframe-based API, the Vulkan code was much improved,
	many new filters were added, including libplacebo integration, and
	finally, DoVi support was added, including tonemapping and
	remuxing. The default AAC encoder settings were also changed to
	improve quality.]]></summary>

December 29.  There were, of course, other things going on around that
time, holidays, vacations, and so forth, so the discussion was relatively
muted until recently.  Proponents have a number of reasons why they would like

some GCC improvements to defend against bidirectional-text attacks in

	My colleague Marek Polacek and I implemented a new warning for GCC
	12, -Wbidi-chars, for detecting Trojan Source attacks involving
	Unicode control characters. Marek implemented the guts of the
	warning, but when I tried it out on the examples provided by the
	Trojan Source researchers, I found I had trouble understanding the
	initial results—precisely because of the obfuscation itself.
	
	So for GCC 12, I've added a new flag to GCC diagnostics, indicating
	that the diagnostic itself relates to source code encoding. When
	any such diagnostic is printed, GCC will now escape non-ASCII

Ads Review Tool
   
This tool flags (and optionally deletes) policy violating ads across your accounts. Advertisers can learn from the output to ensure their ads are compliant with Google Ads Policies at all times. 
Business Challenge:
Advertisers operating at scale need a solution to holistically review policy violating ads across their accounts so they can ensure compliance with Google’s Ad Policies. As Google introduces more policies and enforcement mechanisms, advertisers need to continue checking their accounts to ensure they comply with Google’s Ads Policies.
Solution Overview:  
“Disapproved Ads Auditor” is a tool  that enables advertisers to review at scale all disapproved ads across their  Google Ads accounts. This view  allows advertisers to proactively audit their accounts , analyze the ad disapprovals holistically and identify  learnings to minimize and  reduce submission of potentially policy violating ads. 
The tool is based on a Python script, which can be run in either of the following modes: 
 
“Audit Mode”- export an output of disapproved ads across your accounts 
“Remove Mode” - delete currently disapproved ads and log details.
 
There are a few output files (see here) which are saved locally under the “output” folder and there is an optional feature to export on BigQuery for further data analysis (“Disapproved Ads Auditor” dataset). 
Skills Required:   
 
 Python 3.9+ 
 BigQuery API 
 Google Ads API 
 OAuth 2.0
 
Google Products Used:
 
Google Ads  
BigQuery
 
Estimated time to implement the solution: ~2h 
Implementation instructions: View on github
Impact:
“Disapproved Ads Auditor” tool automates auditing ads across your accounts to provide you insights into non compliant ads. You can take the learnings from the output to ensure ads are compliant with Google Ads Policies and avoid creating non compliant ads. Moreover, you can optionally remove disapproved ads.]]></summary>

	The reason behind this mischief on the developer's part appears to

Depending on how we count, C++20 brought around 80 Library features and 70 language changes, so there’s a lot to cover :)
In this article, I’ll show you 20 smaller C++20 things that are very handy and good to know. Ten language elements, and ten more for the Standard Library. Most of them with a cool example.
Let’s jump right into the text!

might have 
different processing capacities; for example, the Arm big.LITTLE
systems combine fast, power-hungry CPUs with slower, more efficient
ones. Linux has also run for years on simultaneous
multithreading (SMT) architectures, where one CPU executes multiple
independent execution threads and is seen as if it were multiple cores.
There are architectures that mix both approaches. A recent discussion
on a patch

secure remote logins is used widely within our communities; it also
underlies things like remote Git repository access.
A recent experimental feature for the upcoming OpenSSH 8.9 release
will help close a security hole 
that can be exploited by attacker-controlled SSH servers (e.g. sshd) when the user is forwarding
authentication to a local ssh-agent.  Instead
of allowing the keys held in the agent to be used for authenticating to any
host where they might work, SSH agent 
restriction will allow users to specify where and how those keys can be
used.]]></summary>

      more of his Patterns of Distributed Systems. With this one he attempts the
      tricky task of explaining Paxos. This is a well-known
      protocol developed by Leslie Lamport, for nodes to reach a reliable
      consensus when both they, and the network, are prone to unexpected
      failure. Although it's well-known, it's also notoriously difficult to
      understand, indeed we had considerable difficulty getting our heads around
      it. We hope this description makes it a bit easier for those who follow
      us.

it seems, going quite well:


  For many years our work was mainly financed by donations and smaller
  projects.  Now we have reached a point where we can benefit from a
  continuous revenue stream to maintain and extend the software without
  asking for donations or grants.  This is quite a new experience to us
  and I am actually a bit proud to lead one of the few self-sustaining
  free software projects who had not to sacrifice the goals of the
  movement.


He concludes with a request for individuals who have been donating to GnuPG
to redirect their generosity toward another deserving project.  This is
good news; GnuPG ran on a shoestring for far too long.]]></summary>

	Some features took a lot of time, mostly when we changed core

A few weeks ago, I experimented with a code kata and implemented a container and an iterator for “vectors of vectors.” I set the C++20 flag in Compiler Explorer wrote the code. But then I tried the C++17 flag, and I was surprised to see how much I had to add to compile it!
To simplify things, let’s look at a simple wrapper for a container class. It uses std::vector as internal storage and only exposes some essential functionality.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A hard reality of C and C++ software development on Windows is that there
has never been a good, native C or C++ standard library implementation for
the platform. A standard library should abstract over the underlying host
facilities in order to ease portable software development. On Windows, C
and C++ is so poorly hooked up to operating system interfaces that most
portable or mostly-portable software — programs which work perfectly
elsewhere — are subtly broken on Windows, particularly outside of the
English-speaking world. The reasons are almost certainly political,
originally motivated by vendor lock-in, than technical, which adds insult
to injury. This article is about what’s wrong, how it’s wrong, and some
easy techniques to deal with it in portable software.

go, any overhead hurts.  The cost of copying data to be transmitted
from user space into the kernel can be especially painful; it adds latency,
takes
valuable CPU time, and can be hard on cache performance.  So it is
unsurprising that the developers working with io_uring, which is all about performance, have
turned their attention to zero-copy network transmission.  This
patch set from Pavel Begunkov, now in its second revision, looks to be
significantly faster than the MSG_ZEROCOPY option supported by current

Peter Oskolkov posted a patch set implementing an abstraction known as user-managed
concurrency groups, or UMCG.  Several revisions later, many observers

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Jami communication tool has released a major new stable version called "Taranis"; the blog post announcement explains: "Taranis, the Gallic and Celtic god of the sky, lightning and thunder, will be the baptismal name of this new version of Jami."  The mailing-list announcement describes the tool this way:

Jami is a GNU package for universal communication that respects the
freedom and privacy of its users.  Jami is an end-to-end encrypted
secure and distributed voice, video, and chat communication platform
that requires no central server, and leaves the power of privacy and
freedom in the hands of users.


Another recent blog post gives an overview of Jami for video conferences. The new release has improvements throughout the system, including the first phase of Swarm support, which are "fully distributed, peer-to-peer chats with conversation
    histories synchronized across your devices, and the potential to
    be expanded into group chats in upcoming future releases of Jami".]]></summary>

long would be a severe understatement; the developers have clearly been
busy.



	systemd-homed now makes use of UID mapped mounts for the home areas.
          If the kernel and used file system support it, files are now
          internally owned by the "nobody" user (i.e. the user typically used
          for indicating "this ownership is not mapped"), and dynamically
          mapped to the UID used locally on the system via the UID mapping
          mount logic of recent kernels. This makes migrating home areas
          between different systems cheaper because recursively chown()ing file
          system trees is no longer necessary.
