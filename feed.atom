a recent update
that is causing problems for users with systems that dual-boot Windows
and Linux.
"Note that Windows says this update won't apply to systems that
dual-boot Windows and Linux," one frustrated person wrote. "This
obviously isn't true, and likely depends on your system configuration
and the distribution being run. It appears to have made some linux efi
shim bootloaders incompatible with microcrap efi bootloaders (that's
why shifting from MS efi to 'other OS' in efi setup works). It appears
that Mint has a shim version that MS SBAT doesn't recognize."
The reports indicate that multiple distributions, including Debian,
Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Zorin OS, and Puppy Linux, are all
affected. Microsoft has yet to acknowledge the error publicly, explain
how it wasn't detected during testing, or provide technical guidance
to those affected. Company representatives didn't respond to an email
seeking answers.]]></summary>

compared to the amount of time that most users spend with them. Ideally,
a user spends only a few minutes using the installer, versus years using
the distribution after it is installed. Yet, the installer sets the
first impression, and if it fails to do its job, little else matters.
Installers also have to continually evolve to keep pace with new
hardware, changes in distribution packaging (such as image-based Linux
distributions), and so forth. Along those lines, the SUSE team that maintains the
venerable YaST installer has
decided it's time to start (almost) fresh with a new Linux installer
project, called Agama,
for new projects. YaST is not going away as an administration tool,
but it is likely to be relieved of installer duties at some point.]]></summary>

If you've ever tried programming a GPU before, you're probably familiar with vector addition. This is the use case where you have two large arrays of numbers, and you want to build a new array, representing the element-wise sum. This algorithm is normally used to demonstrate the power of GPU programming, by showcasing one way to exploit its massively parallel capabilities. However, although this example is useful, it misses out on the techniques involved in more advanced GPU programming, because it views parallel programming as simply a tool that exists to parallelize certain workloads, rather than a language or set of computational tools…]]></summary>

In this article, we introduce Tempo Monolithic mode, describe the pros and cons, and present example deployment manifests.
What is Tempo Monolithic mode?
In Tempo Monolithic mode all core components such as compactor, distributor, ingester, querier, and query-frontend of Tempo are contained in a single binary, in a single container. This vastly simplifies the deployment, as only a single pod is created, and avoids potential issues arising from distributed deployments such as connectivity issues between pods or nodes, scheduling issues, etc. Additionally, this mode supports storing traces in…]]></summary>

In essence this is an introduction to the inner and outer loops of cloud-native development.
To get started, install Podman Desktop. This step is pretty straightforward, owing to the fact that Podman Desktop has a downloads page that supports typical installation flows for Linux, macOS, and Windows and has setup guides for each platform. Once installed, it will look something like this (Figure 1).

set of goals for the latter half of 2024.


	Rust
	for Linux. The experimental support for Rust
	development in the Linux kernel is a watershed moment for Rust,
	demonstrating to the world that Rust is indeed capable of targeting
	all manner of low-level systems applications. And yet today that
	support rests on a number of
	unstable features, blocking the effort from ever going beyond
	experimental status. For 2024H2 we will work to close the largest
	gaps that block support.


Other goals include completing the 2024 Rust
Edition and improving the language's async support.]]></summary>

Affected machines entered a boot loop or boot recovery mode, rendering them inoperative; this underscores  the critical need for robust automated recovery mechanisms in IT infrastructure. One answer being iterated upon by the open source community is Greenboot, which is currently available in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) for Edge, Red Hat In-Vehicle Operating System and Fedora IoT.
Greenboot is designed to automatically recover from failed upgrades by integrating with systemd and atomically updated distros. It acts as a guardian for your system’s health, so that if an update goes awry, the system can automatica…]]></summary>

But before we go further, for those of you new to Network Observability, it is an optional operator that provides a slew of capabilities to track and provide insight into your network traffic flows. While it works on any Kubernetes cluster, it works even better in a Red Hat OpenShift environment, which is what I will focus on in this article. I will only discuss the new features in this release so if you want the full feature list, read the documentation on About Network Observability.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Researchers from Graz University of Technology have
published details of a new attack
on the Linux kernel called SLUBStick. The attack uses timing information to turn an ability to trigger use-after-free or double-free bugs into the ability to overwrite page tables, and thence into the ability to read and write arbitrary areas of memory. The good news is that this attack does require an existing bug to be usable; the bad news is that the kernel regularly sees bugs of this kind.



We assume that an unprivileged user has code execution. 
Additionally, we consider the presence of a heap vulnerability
in the Linux kernel. We assume that the Linux kernel 
incorporates all defense mechanisms available in version 6.4, the
most recent Linux kernel version when we started our work.
These mechanisms include features such as WˆX, KASLR,
SMAP, and kCFI. We do not assume any microarchitectural 
vulnerabilities, e.g., transient execution, fault
injection, or hardware side channels.]]></summary>

Background
The LLVM libc project was designed as an alternative to glibc that aims to be modular, configurable, and sanitizer-friendly. Currently, LLVM libc is being ported to Nvidia and AMD GPUs to give libc functionality (e.g. printf(), malloc(), and math functions) on the GPU. As of March 2024, programs can use GPU libc in offloading languages (CUDA, OpenMP) or through direct compilation and linking with the libc library.
What We Did
During this project, we developed a microbenchmarking framework that is directly compiled for and run on the GPU, using libc function…]]></summary>

Whilst the features offered by Puppeteer won't be a surprise,
bringing support to multiple browsers has been a significant

automation protocol, but on WebDriver BiDi, a cross browser protocol

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The desire for the ability to checkpoint a process — to record its state in
a form that can be restarted at a future time — on Linux is almost as old as
Linux itself.  See, for example, this announcement of a checkpoint
project that appeared in LWN in 1998.  While working solutions exist, they
can be somewhat fragile and difficult to use; it is not surprising that
some people are interested in finding a better alternative.  A current
effort goes by the name CRIB,
for Checkpoint/Restore in (naturally) BPF.  It is far from clear that CRIB
will replace the existing solutions, but it is an interesting look at a
different way of solving the problem.]]></summary>

This is the fifth maintenance release of Python 3.12
Python 3.12 is the newest major release of the Python programming

Teach you the basics of parallel GPU programming, such as the SIMD model.
Walk you through some key algorithms, such as scan/prefix sum, quicksort, and game of life.
Show you working examples of code from OpenAI’s Triton, CUDA, OpenCL, torch.compile, Numba, and HIP/HCC.
Help you determine which framework to use, and go over any common pitfalls.

This guide focuses more on the algorithms and architecture, with a heavy emphasis on how to effectively use the computational model.

the ability to interrupt or kill operations, in order to fix some
longstanding problems with network 
(and other) filesystems, in a session at
the 2024 Linux
Storage, Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit.   As noted in
his session
proposal, some filesystems may be expecting to not be interruptible,
but are calling code can take locks and mutexes that are interruptible (or

Among these improvements, we got changes and additions to enum class functionalities across C++17, C++20, and C++23.

Let’s go.



     
    


Before diving into the enhancements, let’s briefly recap what enum class is. An enum class (scoped enumeration) provides a type-safe way of defining a set of named constants. Unlike traditional (unscoped) enums, enum class does not implicitly convert to integers or other types, preventing accidental misuse. Here’s a basic e…]]></summary>

The preprocessor famously has a number of sharp edges associated with it.
One might not normally think of increased compilation time as one of them,
though.  It turns out that some changes to a couple of conceptually simple
preprocessor macros — min() and max() — led to some truly

While tools like GitHub Copilot have gained popularity as AI pair programmers, the downside is they run on closed models and you might have to pay a subscription to use them. Imagine instead being able to use state-of-the-art free AI coding assistants right on your local machine using powerful open source models, with auto-completions and confidence that your data stays private! 
Let’s take a look at how to integrate an AI code assistant into your IDE using a combination of open source tools, including Continue (an extension for VS Code and JetBrains), Ollama or InstructLab as a local model server, and the Granite family of code models to supercharge your development workflow without any cost …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Detoxifying or preventing toxic content generation from large language models (LLMs) is challenging. Data used to train these models is usually scraped from the internet which often contains toxic content. Without proper guardrails, a model can learn undesirable properties and in turn, generate toxic text. Removing toxic samples from training data can be expensive as it usually requires data annotators to manually identify samples that align with human values. Inherent bias in the annotators themselves can also affect the data labeling process in a negative way. By using the open source project TrustyAI Detoxify in conjunction with Hugging Face's SFTTrainer (Supervised Fine-Tuning Trainer) on Red Hat OpenShift AI, we can help lower the costs of detoxifying LLMs during training.

and complexity than I suspect the interviewer intended. While considering
it, I also came up with a novel, or at least unconventional, solution. The
problem is to deep copy a linked list where each node references a random
list element in addition to usual linkage — similar to LeetCode problem
138. This reference is one of identity rather than value, which has
murky consequences.

typedef struct node node;
struct node {
    node *next;
    node *ref;   // arbitrary node in the list, or null

node *deepcopy(node *);


In the copy, nodes have individual lifetimes allocated using malloc
which the caller is responsible for freeing. While thickheaded, this

If you plan to work with artificial intelligence (AI), most AI tools require S3 storage to store data from models, training, and tuning, besides the raw data on which AI models make inferences and the results of such inferences.

Storage, Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit, John Groves led
a session on famfs, which is a filesystem he has developed that uses the

was aimed at whether a different approach should be taken and, in
particular, whether FUSE should be used instead of implementing as an
in-kernel filesystem.  As noted in the thread about his
proposal for an LSFMM+BPF session, and the mailing-list discussions on the first and second
version of his patch set, there is some skepticism that a new in-kernel

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The steady increase in deployment of AI tools has led a lot of people concerned about how software makes decisions that affect our lives. In one example, its about “algorithmic” feeds in social media that promote posts that drive engagement. A more serious impact can come from business decisions, such as how much premium to charge in car insurance. This can extend to affecting legal decisions, such as suggesting sentencing guidelines to judges.
Faced with these concerns, there is often a movement to restrict the use of algorithms, such as a recent activity in New York to restrict how social media networks generate feeds for children. Should we draw up more laws to fence in the rampaging algorithms?
In my view, the restricting the use of algorithms and AI here isn’t the right target. A regu…]]></summary>

Using a fully distributed architecture, a streams for Apache Kafka cluster requires you to setup and deploy numerous services, ensure they are all properly configured and, even more importantly, that each component is functional and can communicate with each other. 
For all these reasons, applying an automation solution such as Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform to deploy and manage streams for Apache Kafka makes a lot of sense, especially as Ansible now has a collection dedicated for the product.

OpenShift audit logs track a wide range of actions performed by users and services. These logs capture data such as who accessed the system, what actions were taken, and when these actions occurred. By maintaining a detailed and chronological record of these activities, audit logs help administrators monitor the system for unauthorized access, detect potential security breaches, and ensure compliance with organizational and regulatory requirements.

For example, in a traditional situation you’d be upgrading both the control plane and the workers. With HCP, you’re just upgrading the workers in most cases, thus reducing the risk and turnaround time normally associated with standalone installations. For a visual representation of the difference between a standalone setup and HCP, see Figure 1.

Well, to start off. What may be considered a sensitive asset to one individual or organization may not be the same as another. Also, given that there are so many different ways that sensitive assets can be managed, there is no universally accepted method available.
The challenges that encompass how sensitive assets are handled also apply to image mode, a new method that enables building and deploying Operating Systems using similar tools and approaches as any other traditional container.

Technical Advisory Committee (TAC). The communities will elect the
members of the BACs and TACs, creating a direct channel for community
input in roadmap development and reflecting the diverse perspectives
of OpenSSL's communities.
OpenSSL has also announced that two projects have adopted the OpenSSL Mission

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's Encrypt has
announced
that it intends to end support "as soon as possible" for the 

Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) over privacy concerns. OCSP was developed as a
lighter-weight alternative to

Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) that did not involve downloading
the entire CRL in order to check whether a certificate was valid. Let's Encrypt will continue
supporting OCSP as long as it is a requirement for Microsoft's

Trusted Root Program, but hopes to discontinue it soon:



We plan to end support for OCSP primarily because it represents a considerable risk to privacy on the Internet. When someone visits a website using a browser or other software that checks for certificate revocation via OCSP, the Certificate Authority (CA) operating the OCSP responder immediately becomes aware of which website is being visited from that visitor's particular IP address. Even when a CA intentionally does not retain this information, as is the case with Let's Encrypt, CAs could be legally compelled to collect it. CRLs do not have this issue.



People using Let's Encrypt as their CA should, for the most part, not need to change their setups.
All modern browsers support CRLs, so end-users shouldn't notice an impact either.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Simon Willison, co-creator of the popular Django web framework for Python,
gave a keynote presentation at PyCon 2024 on a topic that is
unrelated to that work: large language models (LLMs).
The topic grew out of some other work that he is doing on Datasette, which is a Python-based
"tool for exploring and publishing data".  The talk was a look
beyond the hype to try to discover what useful things you can actually do
today using these models.  Unsurprisingly, there were some
cautionary notes from Willison, as well.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Python Software Foundation (PSF) board has announced
improvements to its grants program that have been enacted as a
response to "concerns and frustrations" with the program:
open letter from the pan-African delegation
seriously, and we began to draft a plan to address everything in the
letter. We also set up improved two-way communications so that we can
continue the conversation with the community. The writers of the open
letter have now met several times with members of the PSF board. We
are thankful for their insight and guidance on how we can work
together and be thoroughly and consistently supportive of the
pan-African Python community.


So far the PSF has set up office
hours to improve communications, published
a retrospective on the DjangoCon Africa review, and put out a transparency
report on grants from the past two years. The PSF board has also
voted to "use the same criteria for all grant requests, no matter
their country of origin".]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mark Zuckerberg has posted
an article announcing some new releases of the Llama large language
model and going on at length about why open-source models are important:


	AI has more potential than any other modern technology to increase
	human productivity, creativity, and quality of life – and to
	accelerate economic growth while unlocking progress in medical and
	scientific research. Open source will ensure that more people
	around the world have access to the benefits and opportunities of
	AI, that power isn't concentrated in the hands of a small number of
	companies, and that the technology can be deployed more evenly and
	safely across society.

	There is an ongoing debate about the safety of open source AI
	models, and my view is that open source AI will be safer than the
	alternatives. I think governments will conclude it's in their
	interest to support open source because it will make the world more
	prosperous and safer.


Of course, whether Llama is truly open source is debatable at best, but it
is more open than many of the alternatives.]]></summary>

since its initial introduction to Linux, usually through the lens of the newest
developments; this can make it hard to view the whole picture. BPF provides
a way to extend a running kernel, without having to recompile and reboot.
It does this in a safe way, so that malicious BPF
programs cannot crash a running kernel, thanks to the BPF verifier. So how does
the verifier actually work, what are its limits, and how has it changed since
the early days of BPF?]]></summary>
