  free software projects who had not to sacrifice the goals of the

to redirect their generosity toward another deserving project.  This is

state machine, I will check the Graphviz, gnuplot, or SVG
source into source control alongside the image in case I need to make
changes in the future. Sometimes I even make the image itself a link to
its source file. I’ve thought it would be convenient if the raster image
somehow contained its own source as metadata so that they don’t get
separated. I looked around and wasn’t satisfied with the solutions I
found, so I wrote one: pngattach.
My approach introduces a new private chunk type atCh (“attachment”)
which contains a file name, a flag to indicate if the attachment is
compressed, and an optionally DEFLATE-compressed blob of file contents. I
tried to follow the spirit of PNG chunk formatting, but without the
constrain…]]></summary>

has never been a good, native C or C++ standard library implementation for
the platform. A standard library should abstract over the underlying host
facilities in order to ease portable software development. On Windows, C
and C++ is so poorly hooked up to operating system interfaces that most
portable or mostly-portable software — programs which work perfectly
elsewhere — are subtly broken on Windows, particularly outside of the
English-speaking world. The reasons are almost certainly political,
originally motivated by vendor lock-in, than technical, which adds insult
to injury. This article is about what’s wrong, how it’s wrong, and some
easy techniques to deal with it in portable software.

go, any overhead hurts.  The cost of copying data to be transmitted
from user space into the kernel can be especially painful; it adds latency,
takes
valuable CPU time, and can be hard on cache performance.  So it is
unsurprising that the developers working with io_uring, which is all about performance, have

reasonably well, but that's not enough for all users.  Specifically, there
are use cases out there that benefit from a lightweight threading model
that gives user space control over scheduling decisions.  Back in May 2021,
Peter Oskolkov posted a patch set implementing an abstraction known as user-managed
concurrency groups, or UMCG.  Several revisions later, many observers
still lack a clear idea of what this patch is supposed to do, much less
whether it is a good idea for the kernel.  Things have taken a turn,
though, with Peter Zijlstra's reimplementation
of UMCG.]]></summary>

The mailing-list announcement describes the tool this way:

Jami is a GNU package for universal communication that respects the
freedom and privacy of its users.  Jami is an end-to-end encrypted
secure and distributed voice, video, and chat communication platform
that requires no central server, and leaves the power of privacy and
freedom in the hands of users.


Another recent blog post gives an overview of Jami for video conferences. The new release has improvements throughout the system, including the first phase of Swarm support, which are "fully distributed, peer-to-peer chats with conversation
    histories synchronized across your devices, and the potential to
    be expanded into group chats in upcoming future releases of Jami".]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Systemd 250 has been released.  To say that the list of new features is
long would be a severe understatement; the developers have clearly been
busy.



	systemd-homed now makes use of UID mapped mounts for the home areas.
          If the kernel and used file system support it, files are now
          internally owned by the "nobody" user (i.e. the user typically used
          for indicating "this ownership is not mapped"), and dynamically
          mapped to the UID used locally on the system via the UID mapping
          mount logic of recent kernels. This makes migrating home areas
          between different systems cheaper because recursively chown()ing file
          system trees is no longer necessary.


(See this article for a description of
ID-mapped mounts).]]></summary>

subscription is about to expire. You might have even met me at a

in the background watching the LWN mailbox, looking for brief items and

that this project provides will be a catalyst for strengthening existing

Every developer’s path to pursuing a career in tech can be traced back to a single moment. Such is the case for Ning Zhang, a developer from China, who found his early interest in web development as a high schooler at the age of fifteen. Ning built his first website for his English class to help his classmates succeed with their studies. He didn’t realize it at the time, but he was only just getting started. Throughout high school, he played with Google Webmaster Tools (now Google Search Console) and Google Adsense to create and manage numerous other websites for fun. Like so many aspiring developers before him, Ning knew he’d found his passion, but the path ahead remained unclear.

At Twitter, most  CPU bound services start falling over at around 50% reserved container CPU utilization and almost all services start falling over at not much more CPU utilization even though CPU bound services should, theoretically, be able to get higher CPU utilizations. Because load isn't, in general, evenly balanced across shards and the shard-level degradation in performance is so severe when we exceed 50% CPU utilization, this makes the prac…]]></summary>

Getting back to numeracy activities, GCompris 2.0 includes a wide range of activities that mimic basic manipulation math games, allowing young players to experiment with elements, grouping them in sets of up to ten items. This helps them build a clear concept of the decimal system, and, as with many GCompris activities, an educator can gradually increase the difficulty level, allowing the activities to be used with children of ages between 3 and 10. Once they grasp the concept of the decimal system, the addition and subtraction activities, also based on math manipulation, help practice arithmetic.

Along with other classics, like chess, align four, and checkers, fans of strategy games will enjoy Oware, a game that requires forethought and, again, numeracy skills. Oware is originally a traditional African pastime and can be played against a friend or against Tux, offering unlimited hours of fun.]]></summary>

debate for Python, back in August, two PEPs were still being
discussed as alternatives for handling annotations in the language.
The steering council was considering the issue after deferring on a
decision for the Python 3.10 release, but the question has been
deferred again for Python 3.11.  More study is needed and the council
is looking for help from the Python community to guide its
decision.  In the meantime, though, discussion about the deferral has led
to the understanding that annotations are not a general-purpose feature,
but are only meant for typing information.  In addition, there is a growing
realization that typing information is effectively becoming mandatory
for Python libraries.]]></summary>

Some challenges affect everyone regardless of borders or nationality, and combating climate issues is no different. Aysu Keçeci, a student in Turkey with an avowed reverence for the sea, found herself increasingly distressed by the growing amount of plastic in the world’s oceans. She notes, “As an Aegean, the seas are a big part of my life, Unfortunately, I have grown up observing that our waters are polluted daily, and I know that plastics now make up 80% of marine garbage, and if we don't take precautions, there will be more plastic in our seas than fish in 2050. That's why plastic pollution has always been a problem I wanted to address.”

advisory from Apache describes a nasty vulnerability in the widely used
Log4j package.


	Apache Log4j2 <=2.14.1 JNDI features used in configuration, log
	messages, and parameters do not protect against attacker controlled
	LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. An attacker who can control
	log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code
	loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is
	enabled. From log4j 2.15.0, this behavior has been disabled by
	default.


Updating this package is, of course, necessary, but that will only help so
much; it is bundled into a lot of other deployed products.

contributor Fredrik Lundh has died.


	Fredrik was an early Python contributor (e.g. Elementtree and the

	countless hours on comp.lang.python answering questions from
	newbies and advanced users alike.

	He also co-founded an early Python startup, Secret Labs AB, which
	among other software released an IDE named PythonWorks. Fredrik
	also created the Python Imaging Library (PIL) which is still THE

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Feature deprecations are often controversial, but many projects find it
necessary, or desirable, to lose some of the baggage that has accreted over
time.  A mid-November request to get rid of three Python standard library
modules provides a case in point.  It was initially greeted as a good idea
since the modules had been officially deprecated starting with
Python 3.6; there are better ways to accomplish their
tasks now.  But, of course, removing a module breaks any project that uses
it, at least without the project making some, perhaps even trivial,
changes.  The cost of that is not insignificant, and the value in doing so
is not always clear, which led to higher-level conversation about deprecations.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reference counts are a commonly used mechanism for tracking the life cycle
of objects in a computing system.  As long as every user of an object
correctly maintains its references by incrementing and decrementing the
reference count, that object will persist for as long as it
is needed
and will be properly destroyed once the last user is done.  The "correctly"
in that sentence is important, though; things do not work
as well in the presence of reference-counting errors.  Networking
developer Eric Dumazet is working on a
reference-count tracking system that could prove useful for finding
these errors in the networking subsystem and, someday, throughout the kernel.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this post we're going to walk through how to use GitHub Actions to create a continuous integration (CI) pipeline that automatically tests, vets and lints your Go code.
For solo projects I usually create a pre-commit Git hook to carry out these kinds of checks, but for team projects or open-source work — where you don't have control over everyone's development environment — using a CI workflow is a great way to flag up potential problems and help catch bugs before they make it into production or a versioned release.
And if you're already using GitHub to host your repository, it's nice and easy to use their built-in functionality to do this without any need for additional third-party tools or services.
To demonstrate how it works, let's run through a step-by-step example.
