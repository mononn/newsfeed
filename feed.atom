include version numbering, the limited C API, a new default read-eval-print

	For multiple reasons like being able to fix bugs and
	single-maintainer modules, CPython doesn't require reviewers on the
	pull requests of core developers. This can lead to "unilateral

streamlined user experience in GNOME Software to let you install the binary NVIDIA driver and provide you with an integrated graphical user interface help to sign the kernel module for use with secure boot. This is a bit different than what we for instance are doing in RHEL, where we are working with NVIDIA to provide pre-signed kernel modules, but that is a lot harder to do in Fedora due to the rapidly updating kernel versions and which most Fedora users appreciate as a big plus. So instead what we are for opting in Fedora is as I said to make it simple for you to self-sign the kernel module for use with secure boot. We are currently looking at when we can make this feature available, but no later than Fedora Workstation 41 for sure.]]></summary>

Placing functions that reference each other frequently in the same area of memory can help reduce the need to load and unload pages of memory. Similarly, pieces of data that are used a lot at the same time benefit from being located in the same region of memory.
Alternatively, sometimes it is better not to group code and data based upon its use, but rather upon its similarity to each other. Placing similar code and data in adjacent memory regions means that the binary image can be compressed to a greater degree, a feature which is often important for mobile applications.

Connectivity Link is based on the upstream Kuadrant project and was released as a Developer Preview at Red Hat Summit 2024, with the goal of going GA in the fall of 2024.
In this article, I will demonstrate how to get started with Connectivity Link on Red Hat OpenShift. Connectivity Link is not limited to OpenShift, and can be installed and used on other Kubernetes distributions like EKS. However, the installation is much simpler on OpenShift as the required operators can be installed and managed through the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM).

When doing Quarkus builds for OpenShift, there are several approaches. One of the simplest is the Quarkus Maven plug-in, meaning that the usage of quarkus-openshift extension considerably facilitates the deployment.
Either via pom.xml setting the following dependency:

Protocol-independent Packet Processors", is a programming language aimed at
networking devices; it is useful for the configuration of firewalls and
complicated routing architectures.  Since a lot of advanced networking is
done with Linux systems, it stands to reason that there would be value in
supporting P4 and, indeed, an
implementation of P4 in the kernel's traffic-control subsystem was
first posted by Jamal Hadi Salim at the beginning of 2023.  After nearly
18 months, though, this feature has not been merged, and the chances

As a cultural initiative, DevOps has probably made software more reliable and its creation more rapid. Its best understood practices have benefited their progenitors, publicizers, and most successful adopters. Developer engagement with deployment concerns engenders a systems thinking that improves application architecture, but DevOps declares for developers an unbounded array of new concepts, terms, and concerns.
This increase in cognitive load can make it feel like the early returns from DevOps practices such as automation and “infrastructure as code” and its progression toward GitOps are diminishing and progress slowing. More than 80% of developers say they have some kind o…]]></summary>

For the last five episodes/articles, I’ve covered most of the language features. Now it’s time for the Standard Library. I’ve planned three posts on that: Filesystem, Parallel STL and Concurrency, Utils.
Maybe I was a bit harsh in the introduction. Although the Standard Library lacks some important features, you could always use Boost with its thousands of sub-libraries and do the work. The C++ Committee and the Community decided that the Boost libraries are so important…]]></summary>

but sometimes you need a dedicated discrete ADC. At the extremes of the "speed spectrum"
there are "slow but precise" ADCs (that tend to use SPI or I2C),
and absolute monsters with SerDes outputs that can only be consumed by an FPGA.
My application needed an ADC from the middle ground but with multiple channels and simultaneous sampling.
Interfacing a medium-speed multichannel ADC to an SAM E70 MCU turned out more interesting than I wished for. 😊]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to CrowdStrike, a

vulnerability in the Linux kernel's nftables code
that was  discovered earlier this
year is being actively exploited in the wild. The vulnerability allows for
local privilege escalation. Most distributions have already released a fix.



As noted by the exploit developer, leveraging this POC is dependent on the
kernel's unprivileged user namespaces feature accessing nf_tables. This access
is enabled by default on Debian, Ubuntu and kernel capture-the-flag (CTF)
distributions. An attacker can then trigger the double-free vulnerability, scan
the physical memory for the kernel base address, bypass kernel address-space
layout randomization (KASLR) and access the modprobe_path kernel variable with
read/write privileges. After overwriting the modprobe_path, the exploit drops a

the page cache, and direct I/O, which goes directly to the storage device.
The performance of buffered I/O was reported to be a lot worse than direct

proposal for a session at the 2024 Linux Storage,

The proposal resulted in a lengthy mailing-list discussion,

It is considered by many to be the de facto standard for low latency, high throughput, scale out message processing, and data streaming. Kafka is also a data store and therefore subject to many of the same security and compliance obligations as databases, such as encryption at rest.
Encrypting Kafka data at rest 
Apache Kafka does not provide a facility for encrypting sensitive data at rest. Infrastructure providers usually compensate for this by deploying file system or volume encryption. However, encrypting at this level has drawbacks. First, operations personnel and services with file system permissions may view data content. Secondly, file system and volume encryption is not differentiated wi…]]></summary>

when the double-length session on the BPF memory model at the
Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit turned out to be
understandable. Paul McKenney led the session, although he was clear that the
work he was presenting was also due to Puranjay Mohan, who unfortunately could
not attend the summit.
BPF does not actually have a formalized memory model yet;
instead it has relied on a history of talks like this one and a general informal understanding.
Unfortunately, ignoring memory models does not make them go away, and this has
already caused at least one BPF-related bug on weakly-ordered architectures.
Figuring out what a formal memory model for BPF should define was the focus of
McKenney's talk.]]></summary>

on reducing software's environmental impact, has announced its Opt
Green campaign to reduce e-waste:
Over the next two years, the "Opt Green" initiative will bring what
KDE Eco has been doing for sustainable software directly to end
users. A particular target group for the project is those whose
consumer behavior is driven by principles related to the environment,
and not just price or convenience: the "eco-consumers".
Through online and offline campaigns as well as installation
workshops, we will demonstrate the power of Free Software to drive
down resource and energy consumption, and keep devices in use for the
lifespan of the hardware, not the software.
Our motto: The most environmentally-friendly device is the
one you already own.

which was intended to be entirely invisible to existing applications,
already ran into trouble in March, when a

This is a summary of the publicly available documents on the 2011-2012 FTC investigation of Google's allegedly antitcompetive actions in search and ads, followed by a tech-focused analysis of the decision from someone who's worked at the two companies that are discussed in the most detail in the memos (Google and Microsoft), worked in search, and worked closely with ads teams on optimizing ads ranking algorithms. I've seen a number of law-focused and economics-focused analyses, but I haven't seen a tech-focused analysis in a level of detail I find satisfying. In particular, a number of key arguments in the memos rely on evidence and inferences that would've seen implausible to so…]]></summary>

upon a concise technique for dynamic growth — an efficient, generic
“concatenate anything to anything” within an arena built atop a core of
9-ish lines of code. The key insight originated from a reader suggestion
about dynamic arrays. The subject of concatenation can be a string,
dynamic array, or even something else. The “system” is extensible, and
especially useful for path handling.
Continuing from last time, the examples are in light, C-style C++.
I chose it because templates and function overloading express the concepts
succinctly. It uses no standard library functionality, so converting to C,
or similar, should be straightforward. The core concatenation “operator”:

exist, or a subscript that may fall out of bounds. It’s easy to miss
the edge cases where results overflow, creating a nasty, subtle bug, even
in the presence of type safety. Ideally such computations happen in
specialized code, such as inside an allocator (calloc, reallocarray)
and not outside by the allocatee (i.e. malloc). Mitigations exist with
different trade-offs: arbitrary precision, or using a wider fixed integer
— i.e. 128-bit integers on 64-bit hosts. In the typical case, working only
with fixed size-type integers, I’ve come up with a set of guidelines to
avoid overflows in the edge cases.
Range check before computing a result. No exceptions.

Graphite blog post retells the history of the BitKeeper fiasco and the
dawn of the Git era.


	When we think of history, we often romanticize it as being born of
	a sudden stroke of inspiration. But the creation of git shows the
	far harsher reality of invention: a slowly escalating disagreement
	over a license; the need for a scrappy backup solution to unblock
	work; and then continued polishing and iteration through years and
	years, led not by the inventor, but rather a community.


For those who weren't around in those days, a perusal of the LWN coverage
from the time might be of interest too, including:


 Our first mention of BitKeeper

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The interaction of AI/ML and edge computing occurs in a variety of businesses. For example, in the retail industry, customer behavior and patterns can be used to determine promotions. In a manufacturing facility, likewise, data inference can help improve processes where machines are failing, products are not up to standard, and so on. The basic premise is that you might collect data and then infer from it in order to make decisions based on it.
In the context of this retail use case example, a superstore company has branches spread across the country. Each branch decides the products it wants to sell and can customize an AI/ML intelligent app for customers to use.

What is disaster recovery?
There are many options to consider when it comes to the concepts of business continuity and disaster recovery. Primarily we find ourselves concerned with two major metrics: the recovery point objective (RPO) and the recovery time objective (RTO). 
The RPO is what amount of data is considered an acceptable loss in the event of a disaster. If you lose data due to an unforeseen event, and your last successful backup and restore point is three days old, is that an acceptable loss of data?

an accurate idea of how memory is being used, but the kernel's

memory-allocation profiling work, which is meant to address this
shortcoming, at the 2023 Linux Storage, Filesystem, Memory Management, and

ran into opposition that played out at length on the mailing lists (example)

developers often have to go far out of their way to avoid using too much
stack space.  The size of the stack is also fixed, leading to situations
where it is too small for some code paths, while wastefully large for
others.  At the 2024 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit, Pasha Tatashin proposed
making the kernel stack size dynamic, making more space available when
needed while saving memory overall.  This change is not as easy to

       to test the HTML that's generated through templates. While these can be

       slow and more work to maintain than unit tests. My colleague
       Matteo Vaccari has written an article on how to use TDD
       to test drive these templates using xunit-style tools which can be run

In this first installment Matteo describes how such tests can check the

The addition of NMT will allow users of Native Image to better understand how their applications are using off-heap memory. 
Background
The terminology “native memory” is sometimes used interchangeably with “off-heap memory” or “unmanaged memory.” When a Java application is run on the JVM, "native memory" refers to any memory not allocated on the Java heap. Since the the JVM is implemented in C++, this includes the memory that the JVM uses under the hood for its internal operations as well as memory requested with Unsafe#allocateMemory(long), or from external libraries.…]]></summary>

	Bundles are multiple buffers used in a single operation. On the

	buffers, reducing the roundtrip through the networking stack from N
	per N buffers to just a single one. On the send side, this also
	enables better handling of how an application deals with sends from

Software evolution and compatibility
Linux distributions are a living thing. During their lifetime, they are born at release, receive updates, and eventually "die" when support ends. They spawn descendant distributions. They sometimes even fight! The whole point of the distribution is to make an interdependent, cohesive whole, so there are many shared components. When those shared components are changed within a distribution, the question of compatibility is imminent.

subsystem was the subject of the first session in the memory-management
track at the Linux
Storage, Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit.  DAMON
maintainer SeongJae Park introduced the data-access monitoring
framework, which can generate snapshots of how memory is accessed, enabling
the detection of hot and cold regions of memory in both the virtual and
physical address spaces.  The session covered recent changes and future
plans for this tool.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ronnie Sahlberg, Jonathan Maple, and Jeremy Allison of CiQ have published
a white
paper looking at the security-relevant bug fixes applied (or not
applied) to the RHEL 8.x kernel over time.


	This means that over time, the security of the RHEL kernels get
	worse and worse as more issues are discovered in the upstream code
	and are potentially exploitable but fewer and fewer of the fixes
	for these known bugs are back-ported into RHEL kernels.

	After reaching RHEL 8.7, the theory is that the kernel has been
	stabilized, with a corresponding improvement in security. However
	we still have an influx of newly discovered bugs in the upstream
	kernel affecting RHEL 8.7 that are not addressed. Each minor
	version of upstream is released on an approximately quarterly basis
	and we can see that the influx of new bugs that are unaddressed in
	RHEL is growing. The number of known issues in these kernels
	increases by approximately 250 new bugs per quarter or more.]]></summary>
