	Rust

	development in the Linux kernel is a watershed moment for Rust,
	demonstrating to the world that Rust is indeed capable of targeting
	all manner of low-level systems applications. And yet today that
	support rests on a number of
	unstable features, blocking the effort from ever going beyond

Other goals include completing the 2024 Rust

Affected machines entered a boot loop or boot recovery mode, rendering them inoperative; this underscores  the critical need for robust automated recovery mechanisms in IT infrastructure. One answer being iterated upon by the open source community is Greenboot, which is currently available in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) for Edge, Red Hat In-Vehicle Operating System and Fedora IoT.
Greenboot is designed to automatically recover from failed upgrades by integrating with systemd and atomically updated distros. It acts as a guardian for your system’s health, so that if an update goes awry, the system can automatica…]]></summary>

While it works on any Kubernetes cluster, it works even better in a Red Hat OpenShift environment, which is what I will focus on in this article.

in point, a proposal to make a one-line change in an informational text
file on systems running the Debian unstable distribution has blown up into
an interminable and sometimes unfriendly debate.  At its core, though, this
discussion comes down to a seemingly simple question: should a program be
able to determine whether it is running on a Debian testing or unstable
system?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Researchers from Graz University of Technology have
published details of a new attack
on the Linux kernel called SLUBStick. The attack uses timing information to turn an ability to trigger use-after-free or double-free bugs into the ability to overwrite page tables, and thence into the ability to read and write arbitrary areas of memory. The good news is that this attack does require an existing bug to be usable; the bad news is that the kernel regularly sees bugs of this kind.



We assume that an unprivileged user has code execution. 
Additionally, we consider the presence of a heap vulnerability
in the Linux kernel. We assume that the Linux kernel 
incorporates all defense mechanisms available in version 6.4, the
most recent Linux kernel version when we started our work.
These mechanisms include features such as WˆX, KASLR,
SMAP, and kCFI. We do not assume any microarchitectural 
vulnerabilities, e.g., transient execution, fault
injection, or hardware side channels.]]></summary>

Background
The LLVM libc project was designed as an alternative to glibc that aims to be modular, configurable, and sanitizer-friendly. Currently, LLVM libc is being ported to Nvidia and AMD GPUs to give libc functionality (e.g. printf(), malloc(), and math functions) on the GPU. As of March 2024, programs can use GPU libc in offloading languages (CUDA, OpenMP) or through direct compilation and linking with the libc library.
What We Did
During this project, we developed a microbenchmarking framework that is directly compiled for and run on the GPU, using libc function…]]></summary>

Beyond wanting to travel to a future where the bug is fixed, developers will usually try to slow down time with a debugger, so they can examine where things go wrong. But what if even with a debugger, it is still too late and the bug has already happened? Wouldn’t it be nice to be able to go back in time and see it happening in real time?
Let’s talk about time travel debugging. In this post, I’ll go over the following commands:

record stop
record save

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mozilla has announced that Puppeteer, a browser automation and testing library, now has first-class support for Firefox using the
WebDriver BiDi protocol. Puppeteer can be used to drive headless browser instances, and is commonly used for automated end-to-end web site tests.



Whilst the features offered by Puppeteer won't be a surprise,
bringing support to multiple browsers has been a significant
undertaking. The Firefox support is not based on a Firefox-specific
automation protocol, but on WebDriver BiDi, a cross browser protocol
that's undergoing standardization at the W3C, and currently has
implementation in both Gecko and Chromium. This use of a
cross-browser protocol should make it much easier to support many
different browsers going forward.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The desire for the ability to checkpoint a process — to record its state in
a form that can be restarted at a future time — on Linux is almost as old as
Linux itself.  See, for example, this announcement of a checkpoint
project that appeared in LWN in 1998.  While working solutions exist, they
can be somewhat fragile and difficult to use; it is not surprising that
some people are interested in finding a better alternative.  A current
effort goes by the name CRIB,
for Checkpoint/Restore in (naturally) BPF.  It is far from clear that CRIB
will replace the existing solutions, but it is an interesting look at a
different way of solving the problem.]]></summary>

Show you working examples of code from OpenAI’s Triton, CUDA, OpenCL, torch.compile, Numba, and HIP/HCC.
Help you determine which framework to use, and go over any common pitfalls.

This guide focuses more on the algorithms and architecture, with a heavy emphasis on how to effectively use the computational model.

the ability to interrupt or kill operations, in order to fix some
longstanding problems with network

Before diving into the enhancements, let’s briefly recap what enum class is. An enum class (scoped enumeration) provides a type-safe way of defining a set of named constants. Unlike traditional (unscoped) enums, enum class does not implicitly convert to integers or other types, preventing accidental misuse. Here’s a basic e…]]></summary>

preprocessor; indeed, the kernel's use is rather more extensive than most.
The preprocessor famously has a number of sharp edges associated with it.
One might not normally think of increased compilation time as one of them,
though.  It turns out that some changes to a couple of conceptually simple
preprocessor macros — min() and max() — led to some truly

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As developers, we're always looking for ways to be more productive and write higher-quality code. While tools like GitHub Copilot have gained popularity as AI pair programmers, the downside is they run on closed models and you might have to pay a subscription to use them. Imagine instead being able to use state-of-the-art free AI coding assistants right on your local machine using powerful open source models, with auto-completions and confidence that your data stays private! 
Let’s take a look at how to integrate an AI code assistant into your IDE using a combination of open source tools, including Continue (an extension for VS Code and JetBrains), Ollama or InstructLab as a local model server, and the Granite family of code models to supercharge your development workflow without any cost …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Detoxifying or preventing toxic content generation from large language models (LLMs) is challenging. Data used to train these models is usually scraped from the internet which often contains toxic content. Without proper guardrails, a model can learn undesirable properties and in turn, generate toxic text. Removing toxic samples from training data can be expensive as it usually requires data annotators to manually identify samples that align with human values. Inherent bias in the annotators themselves can also affect the data labeling process in a negative way. By using the open source project TrustyAI Detoxify in conjunction with Hugging Face's SFTTrainer (Supervised Fine-Tuning Trainer) on Red Hat OpenShift AI, we can help lower the costs of detoxifying LLMs during training.

and complexity than I suspect the interviewer intended. While considering
it, I also came up with a novel, or at least unconventional, solution. The
problem is to deep copy a linked list where each node references a random
list element in addition to usual linkage — similar to LeetCode problem
138. This reference is one of identity rather than value, which has
murky consequences.

typedef struct node node;
struct node {
    node *next;
    node *ref;   // arbitrary node in the list, or null
};

node *deepcopy(node *);


In the copy, nodes have individual lifetimes allocated using malloc
which the caller is responsible for freeing. While thickheaded, this
is conventional, and I cannot blame the test’s designer for st…]]></summary>

If you plan to work with artificial intelligence (AI), most AI tools require S3 storage to store data from models, training, and tuning, besides the raw data on which AI models make inferences and the results of such inferences.
But, if you have to work on premises, or have to create applications which must work both on premises and on cloud, you require something that provides an S3-compatible API outside of cloud providers.

Storage, Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit, John Groves led
a session on famfs, which is a filesystem he has developed that uses the
kernel's direct-access (DAX)
mechanism to access memory that is shareable between hosts.  The discussion
was aimed at whether a different approach should be taken and, in
particular, whether FUSE should be used instead of implementing as an
in-kernel filesystem.  As noted in the thread about his
proposal for an LSFMM+BPF session, and the mailing-list discussions on the first and second
version of his patch set, there is some skepticism that a new in-kernel
filesystem is warranted for the use case.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The steady increase in deployment of AI tools has led a lot of people concerned about how software makes decisions that affect our lives. In one example, its about “algorithmic” feeds in social media that promote posts that drive engagement. A more serious impact can come from business decisions, such as how much premium to charge in car insurance. This can extend to affecting legal decisions, such as suggesting sentencing guidelines to judges.
Faced with these concerns, there is often a movement to restrict the use of algorithms, such as a recent activity in New York to restrict how social media networks generate feeds for children. Should we draw up more laws to fence in the rampaging algorithms?
In my view, the restricting the use of algorithms and AI here isn’t the right target. A regu…]]></summary>

Using a fully distributed architecture, a streams for Apache Kafka cluster requires you to setup and deploy numerous services, ensure they are all properly configured and, even more importantly, that each component is functional and can communicate with each other. 
For all these reasons, applying an automation solution such as Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform to deploy and manage streams for Apache Kafka makes a lot of sense, especially as Ansible now has a collection dedicated for the product.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Audit logs are a crucial component of any robust IT infrastructure, providing a detailed record of activities and changes within a system. In the context of Red Hat OpenShift, a comprehensive and highly scalable container platform, audit logs play a vital role in ensuring security, compliance, and operational transparency.
OpenShift audit logs track a wide range of actions performed by users and services. These logs capture data such as who accessed the system, what actions were taken, and when these actions occurred. By maintaining a detailed and chronological record of these activities, audit logs help administrators monitor the system for unauthorized access, detect potential security breaches, and ensure compliance with organizational and regulatory requirements.

For example, in a traditional situation you’d be upgrading both the control plane and the workers. With HCP, you’re just upgrading the workers in most cases, thus reducing the risk and turnaround time normally associated with standalone installations. For a visual representation of the difference between a standalone setup and HCP, see Figure 1.

Well, to start off. What may be considered a sensitive asset to one individual or organization may not be the same as another. Also, given that there are so many different ways that sensitive assets can be managed, there is no universally accepted method available.
The challenges that encompass how sensitive assets are handled also apply to image mode, a new method that enables building and deploying Operating Systems using similar tools and approaches as any other traditional container. In this article, we will discuss the types of sensitive assets that apply to image mode for RHEL specifically and how to design appropriate workfl…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's Encrypt has
announced
that it intends to end support "as soon as possible" for the 

Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) over privacy concerns. OCSP was developed as a
lighter-weight alternative to

Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) that did not involve downloading
the entire CRL in order to check whether a certificate was valid. Let's Encrypt will continue
supporting OCSP as long as it is a requirement for Microsoft's

Trusted Root Program, but hopes to discontinue it soon:



We plan to end support for OCSP primarily because it represents a considerable risk to privacy on the Internet. When someone visits a website using a browser or other software that checks for certificate revocation via OCSP, the Certificate Authority (CA) operating the OCSP responder immediately becomes aware of which website is being visited from that visitor's particular IP address. Even when a CA intentionally does not retain this information, as is the case with Let's Encrypt, CAs could be legally compelled to collect it. CRLs do not have this issue.



People using Let's Encrypt as their CA should, for the most part, not need to change their setups.
All modern browsers support CRLs, so end-users shouldn't notice an impact either.]]></summary>

gave a keynote presentation at PyCon 2024 on a topic that is
unrelated to that work: large language models (LLMs).
The topic grew out of some other work that he is doing on Datasette, which is a Python-based
"tool for exploring and publishing data".  The talk was a look
beyond the hype to try to discover what useful things you can actually do
today using these models.  Unsurprisingly, there were some

improvements to its grants program that have been enacted as a
response to "concerns and frustrations" with the program:
open letter from the pan-African delegation
seriously, and we began to draft a plan to address everything in the
letter. We also set up improved two-way communications so that we can
continue the conversation with the community. The writers of the open
letter have now met several times with members of the PSF board. We
are thankful for their insight and guidance on how we can work
together and be thoroughly and consistently supportive of the
pan-African Python community.


So far the PSF has set up office
hours to improve communications, published
a retrospective on the DjangoCon Africa review, and put out a transparency
report on grants from the past two years. The PSF board has also
voted to "use the same criteria for all grant requests, no matter
their country of origin".]]></summary>

an article announcing some new releases of the Llama large language
model and going on at length about why open-source models are important:


	AI has more potential than any other modern technology to increase
	human productivity, creativity, and quality of life – and to
	accelerate economic growth while unlocking progress in medical and
	scientific research. Open source will ensure that more people
	around the world have access to the benefits and opportunities of
	AI, that power isn't concentrated in the hands of a small number of
	companies, and that the technology can be deployed more evenly and
	safely across society.

	There is an ongoing debate about the safety of open source AI
	models, and my view is that open source AI will be safer than the
	alternatives. I think governments will conclude it's in their
	interest to support open source because it will make the world more
	prosperous and safer.


Of course, whether Llama is truly open source is debatable at best, but it
is more open than many of the alternatives.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Myths and misconceptions tend to run rampant in the fast-moving software development space, and with the growing popularity of platform engineering, it's no surprise that there's confusion around the concept. Is platform engineering a developer's dream come true, a magical land of streamlined processes and rapid innovation? Or is it a productivity-sucking plague, a bureaucratic nightmare that slows everything down? 
Buckle up, because we're strapping on our myth-busting goggles and diving deep into the world of platform engineering. We'll separate fact from fiction, explore common myths, and ultimately reveal whether platform engineering is a blessing or a burden for your development workflow.

If you want to follow what we’ve learned, you can check out this learning path that we put together on our journey so far: How to get started with large language models and Node.js.
In our initial learning we followed the most common path by using one of the most popular models from Hugging Face and using tools like ollama and node-llama-cpp to run the models. However, not all models are created equal, and there are a number of aspects that should be considered when choosing a model. The article "Why trust open source AI" is a good introduction to a number of them.

Now that we have KServe installed, it's time to deploy a model. In this post, we will register the popular SKlearn runtime as a custom ServingRuntime and deploy the iris model.
While KServe makes it very easy to deploy models, it doesn't mean that everyone should have access to these models. Restricting access to certain individuals helps conserve resources. In this example, the runtime is CPU-based, but if you're using a GPU-based runtime, this resource issue becomes even more significant. Open Data Hub (ODH) and Red Hat OpenShift AI have made it simpler than ever with the integration of Authorino into the model serving components from ODH 2.10 and OpenShift AI 2.9.

But the NGI project is not among those that would be funded under the current draft budget for 2025,

We find this transformation incomprehensible, moreover when NGI has proven efficient and economical to support free software as a whole, from the smallest to the most established initiatives. This ecosystem diversity backs the strength of European technological innovation, and maintaining the NGI initiative to provide structural support to software projects at the heart of worldwide innovation is key to enforce the sovereignty of a European infrastructure.

there are performance improvements to several individual functions. There are only a few new
features, but several backward-incompatible changes, including a change to
NumPy's numeric-promotion rules. Changes to the Python API require relatively minor changes to

This Metaspace region is a change from previous versions, which had Java Metaspace as part of the heap in the so-called "Permanent Generation" and was set using the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) flag: PermSize and MaxPermSize.

has announced
that it will be changing its logo to remove the feather that has been part
of its brand since 1997.  ASF members will have input on the rebranding process and be
able to vote on the new logo, which will be unveiled at the Community Over Code conference in October.


The feather is a well-loved and iconic part of the ASF brand. We know of community members who have ASF feather tattoos. People love taking photos with the feather at our flagship event each year. 

So why would we change it? As a non-Indigenous entity, we acknowledge that it is inappropriate for the Foundation to use Indigenous themes or language. We thank Natives in Tech and other members of the broader open source community for bringing this issue to the forefront. Today we are announcing we will be retiring the feather icon and logo and replacing it with a new logo that embodies the Foundation's rich history of providing software for the public good.]]></summary>

There has been some longstanding unhappiness in
the XFS-development community
with the stable-kernel process, which led to
backports ceasing for that filesystem until Goldstein started working on XFS testing for the stable
trees a few years ago.  In this year's session, Rumancik updated

most, hardware development companies. Typically led by the electrical
engineering team, it is easy to overlook design issues that will be important to
the firmware team. This post tells of a few stories of design misses that I have
made and puts some common lessons learned into a checklist for other firmware
engineers. It is not meant to be an exhaustive list, but rather a starting point
for a firmware engineer to build their own checklist with the goal of helping
teams catch software/hardware interaction bugs earlier in the design cycle when
they’re cheaper to fix.

the path to safer flexible arrays in the kernel, thanks to the
counted_by attribute supported by Clang 18 and GCC 15.


	There are a number of requirements to properly use the
	counted_by attribute. One crucial requirement is that the
	counter must be initialized before the first reference to the
	flexible-array member. Another requirement is that the array must
	always contain at least as many elements as indicated by the
	counter.

Apps and Stacks container images can be divided into two groups: 

Source-to-Image (S2I) images 
No Source-to-Image (NoS2I) images

Source-to-Image (S2I) is a toolkit and workflow for building reproducible container images from source code.
S2I images are:

S2i-nodejs-container
S2i-php-container
S2i-ruby-container
S2i-python-container
Nginx-container
httpd-container

NoS2I images are:

Postgresql-container
Mysql-container
mariadb-container
Redis-container
varnish-container

Apps and Stacks container images support several operating systems like Fedora, CentOS Stream 8 (C8S), CentOS Stream 9 (C9S), Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8, and RHEL 9, and soon also RHEL 10. CentOS7 and RHE…]]></summary>

This information would empower you to adjust resource controls settings and even enforce best practices if needed. In the long term, this would contribute to large cost savings in your organization. That is where RHACM Right Sizing capabilities becomes an asset and helps you achieve this scenario. 
RHACM Right Sizing complements other Red Hat features in Insights Advisor and Insights Cost Management that recommend your developers to follow best practices when deploying their workloads in the most efficient way. This way, you will be able to monitor whether the best practices…]]></summary>

Back then it didn’t end well for Avast: I found critical vulnerabilities allowing arbitrary websites to infect user’s computer. Worse yet: much of it was due to neglect of secure coding practices, existing security mechanisms were disabled for no good reason. I didn’t finish that investigation because I discovered that the browser was essentially spyware, collecting your browsing history and selling it via Avast’s Jumpshot subsidiary.
But that was almost five years ago. After an initial phase of denial, Avast decided to apologize and to wind down Jumpshot. It was certainly a mere coincidence that Avast was subsequently sold to NortonLifeLock, called Gen Digital today. Yes, Avast is truly reformed and paying for their crimes in Europe …]]></summary>

Fortunately, image mode for RHEL takes many of the benefits that are found in container technologies, including a simplified build process and portability across a variety of environments, and applies them to traditional Virtual Machine workflows. In the prior post, Creating a VMDK using image mode for RHEL, a VMDK-formatted disk image was produced as an output from a bootc image.  
While the VMDK format is open source, they are traditionally used within the VMware family of solutions, such as VMware Workstation and VMware vSphere. In this post, we will describe how the previously created VMDK disk can be used as the basis for a virtual machine hosted in a VMware vSphere environment.

released
the 6.10 kernel.


	So the final week was perhaps not quite as quiet as the preceding
	ones, which I don't love - but it also wasn't noisy enough to
	warrant an extra rc.



Changes in 6.10 include
the removal of support for some ancient Alpha CPUs,
shadow-stack support for the x32 sub-architecture,
Rust-language support on RISC-V systems,
support for some Windows NT synchronization
primitives (though it is marked "broken" in 6.10),
the mseal() system call,
fsverity
support in the FUSE filesystem subsystem,
ioctl() support in the Landlock security
module,
the memory-allocation profiling subsystem,
and more.

for more details.]]></summary>

SDIO project.  It has roughly all the
pieces in place, and so makes sense for an automated testing pipeline.
