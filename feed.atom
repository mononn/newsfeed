 the three new versions of Python released today do not contain Windows 
installers yet. This is temporary, due to a more complex than expected 
code signing certificate renewal.

We’ve held the releases all week while the situation is getting 
resolved but the urgency of 3.10.2 in particular made us release without
 the Windows installers after all. We apologize for the inconvenience 
and are doing everything we can to put the Windows installer in place as
 soon as possible.

We’re rooting for both Ee Durbin and Steve Dower who are helping us 
resolve this. Thanks for your hard work! Hopefully, by this time next

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The deadlines
for various kinds of Fedora 36 change proposals have mostly passed at
this point, which led to something of a flurry of postings to the
distribution's devel mailing list over the last month.  One of those, for a seemingly fairly
innocuous relocation of the RPM database from /var to
/usr, came in right at the buzzer for system-wide changes on
December 29.  There were, of course, other things going on around that
time, holidays, vacations, and so forth, so the discussion was relatively
muted until recently.  Proponents have a number of reasons why they would like
to see the move, but there is resistance, as well, that is due, at least in part, to the
longstanding "tradition" of the location for the database.]]></summary>

some GCC improvements to defend against bidirectional-text attacks in

	My colleague Marek Polacek and I implemented a new warning for GCC
	12, -Wbidi-chars, for detecting Trojan Source attacks involving
	Unicode control characters. Marek implemented the guts of the
	warning, but when I tried it out on the examples provided by the
	Trojan Source researchers, I found I had trouble understanding the
	initial results—precisely because of the obfuscation itself.
	
	So for GCC 12, I've added a new flag to GCC diagnostics, indicating
	that the diagnostic itself relates to source code encoding. When
	any such diagnostic is printed, GCC will now escape non-ASCII
	characters in the source code.]]></summary>

Ads Review Tool
   
This tool flags (and optionally deletes) policy violating ads across your accounts. Advertisers can learn from the output to ensure their ads are compliant with Google Ads Policies at all times. 
Business Challenge:
Advertisers operating at scale need a solution to holistically review policy violating ads across their accounts so they can ensure compliance with Google’s Ad Policies. As Google introduces more policies and enforcement mechanisms, advertisers need to continue checking their accounts to ensure they comply with Google’s Ads Policies.
Solution Overview:  
“Disapproved Ads Auditor” is a tool  that enables advertisers to review at scale all disapproved ads across their  Google Ads accounts. This view  allows advertisers to proactively audit their accounts , analyze the ad disapprovals holistically and identify  learnings to minimize and  reduce submission of potentially policy violating ads. 
The tool is based on a Python script, which can be run in either of the following modes: 
 
“Audit Mode”- export an output of disapproved ads across your accounts 
“Remove Mode” - delete currently disapproved ads and log details.
 
There are a few output files (see here) which are saved locally under the “output” folder and there is an optional feature to export on BigQuery for further data analysis (“Disapproved Ads Auditor” dataset). 
Skills Required:   
 
 Python 3.9+ 
 BigQuery API 
 Google Ads API 
 OAuth 2.0
 
Google Products Used:
 
Google Ads  
BigQuery
 
Estimated time to implement the solution: ~2h 
Implementation instructions: View on github
Impact:
“Disapproved Ads Auditor” tool automates auditing ads across your accounts to provide you insights into non compliant ads. You can take the learnings from the output to ensure ads are compliant with Google Ads Policies and avoid creating non compliant ads. Moreover, you can optionally remove disapproved ads.]]></summary>

	The reason behind this mischief on the developer's part appears to
	be retaliation—against mega-corporations and commercial consumers

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Linux supports processor architectures where CPUs in the same system
might have 
different processing capacities; for example, the Arm big.LITTLE
systems combine fast, power-hungry CPUs with slower, more efficient
ones. Linux has also run for years on simultaneous
multithreading (SMT) architectures, where one CPU executes multiple
independent execution threads and is seen as if it were multiple cores.
There are architectures that mix both approaches. A recent discussion
on a patch
set submitted by Ricardo Neri shows that, on these systems, the
scheduler might distribute tasks in an inefficient way.]]></summary>

Now, almost 18 years later, the project has grown tremendously and those infrastructure choices are not necessarily the right choices today. According to a recent article, the LLVM community experienced record growth in 2021 with 1400 contributors to the LLVM Project. This is incredible growth! While there is a very real cost to change, it is clear that we need to invest in modernizing these tools to support the current and further growth of LLVM.

      failure. Although it's well-known, it's also notoriously difficult to
      understand, indeed we had considerable difficulty getting our heads around

He has just announced a massive
set of patches (touching over half of the files in the kernel tree)
reworking how header files are handled.


	The fast-headers tree offers a +50-80% improvement in absolute
	kernel build performance on supported architectures, depending on
	the config. This is a major step forward in terms of Linux kernel
	build efficiency & performance.

	A justified question would be: why on Earth 2,200 commits??


It seems likely that interesting conversations will follow; stay tuned.]]></summary>

state machine, I will check the Graphviz, gnuplot, or SVG
source into source control alongside the image in case I need to make

its source file. I’ve thought it would be convenient if the raster image
somehow contained its own source as metadata so that they don’t get
separated. I looked around and wasn’t satisfied with the solutions I
found, so I wrote one: pngattach.
My approach introduces a new private chunk type atCh (“attachment”)
which contains a file name, a flag to indicate if the attachment is
compressed, and an optionally DEFLATE-compressed blob of file contents. I
tried to follow the spirit of PNG chunk formatting, but without the

has never been a good, native C or C++ standard library implementation for

and C++ is so poorly hooked up to operating system interfaces that most
portable or mostly-portable software — programs which work perfectly
elsewhere — are subtly broken on Windows, particularly outside of the
English-speaking world. The reasons are almost certainly political,
originally motivated by vendor lock-in, than technical, which adds insult
to injury. This article is about what’s wrong, how it’s wrong, and some

go, any overhead hurts.  The cost of copying data to be transmitted
from user space into the kernel can be especially painful; it adds latency,

valuable CPU time, and can be hard on cache performance.  So it is
unsurprising that the developers working with io_uring, which is all about performance, have

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Jami communication tool has released a major new stable version called "Taranis"; the blog post announcement explains: "Taranis, the Gallic and Celtic god of the sky, lightning and thunder, will be the baptismal name of this new version of Jami."  The mailing-list announcement describes the tool this way:

Jami is a GNU package for universal communication that respects the
freedom and privacy of its users.  Jami is an end-to-end encrypted
secure and distributed voice, video, and chat communication platform
that requires no central server, and leaves the power of privacy and
freedom in the hands of users.


Another recent blog post gives an overview of Jami for video conferences. The new release has improvements throughout the system, including the first phase of Swarm support, which are "fully distributed, peer-to-peer chats with conversation
    histories synchronized across your devices, and the potential to
    be expanded into group chats in upcoming future releases of Jami".]]></summary>

long would be a severe understatement; the developers have clearly been
busy.



	systemd-homed now makes use of UID mapped mounts for the home areas.
          If the kernel and used file system support it, files are now
          internally owned by the "nobody" user (i.e. the user typically used
          for indicating "this ownership is not mapped"), and dynamically
          mapped to the UID used locally on the system via the UID mapping
          mount logic of recent kernels. This makes migrating home areas
          between different systems cheaper because recursively chown()ing file
          system trees is no longer necessary.

ID-mapped mounts).]]></summary>

subscription is about to expire. You might have even met me at a

in the background watching the LWN mailbox, looking for brief items and

Every developer’s path to pursuing a career in tech can be traced back to a single moment. Such is the case for Ning Zhang, a developer from China, who found his early interest in web development as a high schooler at the age of fifteen. Ning built his first website for his English class to help his classmates succeed with their studies. He didn’t realize it at the time, but he was only just getting started. Throughout high school, he played with Google Webmaster Tools (now Google Search Console) and Google Adsense to create and manage numerous other websites for fun. Like so many aspiring developers before him, Ning knew he’d found his passion, but the path ahead remained unclear.

	Regardless of what happens, I will be making an rc8 - not because
	this release looks particularly problematic, but simply due to the
	seasonal holidays. There's no point in releasing a final 5.16 and
	opening the merge window when people are still on holiday or just
	coming back. So we'll have at least one extra week of rc this
	release, even if no nasty issues appear.]]></summary>
