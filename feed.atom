An event-driven architecture
Data integration
Distributed integration

Events play a major role in these types of applications. Events are not new, but event-driven architectures are gaining in popularity and use asynchronous message queue technologies such as RabbitMQ, Apache ActiveMQ, WebLogic, and IBM MQ. In this article, you'll learn how Apache Camel K can make it easier to develop reactive applications on Kubernetes by integrating data sources, Apache Kafka brokers, and Knative for event management.

As defenders, in-the-wild exploit samples give us important insight into what attackers are really doing. We get the “ground truth” data about the vulnerabilities and exploit techniques they’re using, which then informs our further research and guidance to security teams on what could have the biggest impact or return on investment.

is exactly what was recently posted to the mailing list. 
The change targets the C source code in the myriad of packages that the
distribution ships; it would fix code that uses some ancient compatibility
features that were removed by the C99 standard but are still supported by
GCC.  As might be guessed from the 
long runway proposed, there is quite a bit of work to do to get there.]]></summary>

      twitter feed there, so that folks who would rather follow me on Mastodon
      could get everything. To do this, I used moa.party.
      You have to give it credentials to access both your Twitter and Mastodon
      feeds, which is a little worrisome, but my Mastodon-aware colleagues have
      used it without problems. It allows cross-posting in either or both
      directions, but I've set it up to just go from Twitter to Mastodon. It's
      pretty simple and seems to be working. So if you'd like to follow my
      twitter feed from Mastodon, you can now do so.
I'll be monitoring the follower count for the Mastodon account. If lots
      of people follow me on Mastodon, I'll probably do more with it. So
      following my Mastodon feed is vote for me to put more effort into it. But

Earlier this year, I discovered a surprising attack surface hidden deep inside Java’s standard library: A custom JIT compiler processing untrusted XSLT programs, exposed to remote attackers during XML signature verification. This post discusses CVE-2022-34169, an integer truncation bug in this JIT compiler resulting in arbitrary code execution in many Java-based web applications and identity providers that support the SAML single-sign-on standard. 
OpenJDK fixed the discussed issue in July 2022. The Apache BCEL project used by Xalan-J, the origin of the vulnerable code, released a patch in September 2022. 

While the vulnerability discussed in this post has been patched , vendors and users should expect further vulnerabilities in SAML.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Systemd version 252 has been released.  As usual, the list of changes is
long.  It includes a new systemd-measure tool for the calculation of PCR
values and a bunch of infrastructure to use the result for disk encryption:


	Net effect: if you boot a properly prepared kernel, TPM-bound disk
        encryption now defaults to be locked to kernels which carry PCR
          signatures from the same key pair. Example: if a hypothetical distro
          FooOS prepares its UKIs like this, TPM-based disk encryption is now –
          by default – bound to only FooOS kernels, and encrypted volumes bound
          to the TPM cannot be unlocked on kernels from other sources.


There's a lot more; see the announcement for all of the details.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Linux security module (LSM) mechanism was created as a result of the first Kernel Summit in 2001; it was
designed to allow the development of multiple approaches to Linux security.
That goal has been met; there are several security modules available with
current kernels.  The LSM subsystem was not designed, though, to allow
multiple security modules to work together on the same system.  Developers
have been working to rectify that problem almost since the LSM subsystem
was merged, but with limited success; some small security modules can be
stacked on top of the "major" ones, but arbitrary stacking is not possible.
Now, a full 20 years after
security-module support went into the 2.5 development kernel series, it
looks like a solution to the stacking problem may finally be getting
closer.]]></summary>

Modern applications that are more complex than "Hello, world!" usually require several external libraries like OpenSSL, which in turn often need to be properly initialized on startup and deinitialized on shutdown.
OpenSSL libraries are set up internally during program initialization. At this time, they load the configuration file, allocate resources, and handle FIPS mode, among many other tasks.
The OpenSSL API function for initialization is OPENSSL_init_crypto. This function accepts a variety of options with reasonable defaults. Initialization should be performed before any other OpenSSL function is used, though some OpenSSL functions…]]></summary>

that the long-awaited generic associated types feature will be stable in Rust 1.65.


	At its core, generic associated types allow you to have generics
	(type, lifetime, or const) on associated types. Note that this is
	really just rounding out the places where you can put generics: for
	example, you can already have generics on freestanding type aliases

	aliases in traits (which we just call associated types).]]></summary>

most software of interest was written in C; as a result, distributions
are naturally able to efficiently package C applications and the libraries
they depend on.  Modern languages, though, tend to be built around their
own package-management systems that are designed with different goals in
mind.  The result is that, for years, distributors have struggled to find
the best ways to package and ship applications written in those languages.

I've been spending a lot of time researching Windows authentication implementations, specifically Kerberos. In June 2022 I found an interesting issue number 2310 with the handling of RC4 encryption that allowed you to authenticate as another user if you could either interpose on the Kerberos network traffic to and from the KDC or directly if the user was configured to disable typical pre-authentication requirements.

This blog post goes into more detail on how this vulnerability works and how I was able to exploit it with only a bare minimum of brute forcing required. Note, I'm not going to spend time fully explaining how Kerberos authentication works, there's plenty of resources online.

obvious. Some

The answer is "no" — but she draws a distinction between a "standard"
(maintained by some distant standards body) and a "specification".



	While no official decision has been made yet, there does seem to be
	a general agreement that we should indeed work towards having and
	maintaining an official complete Rust specification from within the
	Rust project. It’s just a lot of work, so I’m afraid we won’t get
	there with just some enthusiastic volunteers, even if we can use
	the Ferrocene specification as a start. We’ll need support and
	funding from the Rust Foundation and interested companies.]]></summary>

directly in 
the language and in the standard library. Lists, dictionaries (or "dicts"), and
sets are the foundation, but two of those maintain an order based on how

there is a big push to add the feature, the discussion did show some of
what is generally needed to get new things into the language—and could well

detailed specification for a new approach to "trusted computing"
systems.


	Central to the proposed design is the concept of a Unified Kernel
	Image (UKI). These UKIs are the combination of a Linux kernel
	image, and initrd, a UEFI boot stub program (and further resources,
	see below) into one single UEFI PE file that can either be directly
	invoked by the UEFI firmware (which is useful in particular in some
	cloud/Confidential Computing environments) or through a boot loader
	(which is generally useful to implement support for multiple kernel
	versions, with interactive or automatic selection of image to boot
	into, potentially with automatic fallback management to increase
	robustness).


This work is evidently the first in a series that will come out of the
newly formed Linux Userspace API
Group.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At KubeCon North America 2022, the Podman community unveiled introduced Podman Desktop, a new tool for developers. Podman Desktop allows developers to install, configure, and keep their container engine (Podman) up to date with a GUI. This convenient GUI enables users to interact with containers and pods running in Podman (Figure 1).
Podman Desktop also provides an easy deployment to Kubernetes for developers working with containers on their laptops, allowing a seamless transition from containers to pods and pods to Kubernetes. Podman expands to the desktop to provide a complete experience enabling developers to easily work with containers.

	The challenge is that if you want to pass some bytes to a Rust

CRDs specify how to install, monitor, and manage resources, whereas Operators are agents that actually carry all that out. The usual language for writing an Operator is Go. But most Java teams prefer to keep all their code in Java: they want to avoid doing a deep dive into a new language, and to maintain a unified environment without supporting two sets of tools and practices.

Here are the slides and additional comments from the presentation.



     
    


Initially I did one presentation using my article on smaller C++ 20 features (20 Smaller yet Handy C++20 Features - C++ Stories). Thanks to many valuable discussions during the talk, we decided to do a split. The first meeting was about language parts, and the second part was about library changes.

While the list of topics is in a similar order as the article, I made a few changes:
There’s a constinit slide with more examples instead of the Default Bitfield initializers.
More examples of various features
Additional links and references



     
    


Here are the slides @Xara:
20_cpp20_features_language
20_cpp20_features_library


And


You can also have a look at my YT channel (the C++ Stories YT channel) and see the shorter version of the presentation (around 1 hour): 20 smaller C++20 features (Improved audio) - YouTube.

Red Hat recently took a closer look at a beta release of Ventura to see how easy it would be to run virtualized versions of two key technologies—Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 and the single node version of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform—on Apple silicon.

  suspicious of any kind of general law in the field. Good software architecture

  fight it.
The law is probably best stated, by its author, as:  [1]

APIs are now one of the most popular ways for applications, microservices, and containers to communicate. They offer a wide range of benefits, including reliable communication and data transfer, streamlined development, easy scalability, and cost-effective re-usability. However, as APIs become more prevalent in the cloud-native landscape, they also leave applications vulnerable to many more security risks.
APIs can expose an application and its data, greatly expanding the attack surface and providing a range of new opportunities for attacks. Since APIs are used for communication and data transfer, an insecure API can expose sensitive customer or corporate data, causing reve…]]></summary>

What is CI/CD and why is it important for developers?
Continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) are development processes making use of automated tools to produce high-quality software.
CI ensures that any code submitted by each developer works together with all other code in the project. Typically, CI works by running regression tests.
CD involves further automation to make sure that the latest accepted versions of a project enter production, and that all the pieces deployed together are compatible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since its inclusion in the Linux kernel, the WireGuard VPN tunnel has become
increasingly popular.  In general, WireGuard is simpler to configure than
other VPNs, but the approach that it takes to authentication can present
some challenges. Each node in a WireGuard network has a cryptographic key
that serves as the node's identity; 
nodes that do not know each other's keys cannot directly communicate.
Keeping
track of these keys and distributing them to the other nodes
in a mesh network quickly becomes a chore as the network grows.
Fortunately, there are now 
several open-source 
tools that can automate the management of these keys and make using
WireGuard easier for both administrators and end users.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apache Kafka Streams allow you to implement event-driven and event streaming applications in a distributed environment. Red Hat OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka takes those capabilities to the next level by eliminating the complexity and management involved in implementing and maintaining Kafka instances.
If you're using Amazon Web Services (AWS) to host your Red Hat OpenShift cluster or Red Hat OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka, you'll be pleased to know that the AWS Marketplace now offers Red Hat OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka for AWS (Figure 1).

  


          


This Kafka installation is managed by Red Hat, freeing you to focus on developing code instead of maintaining infrastructure. The service also works alongside the Service Binding Operator in OpenShift. Once you install the Operator, connecting your code to a Kafka instance can be as simple as drag and drop (Figure 2).

  


          


The Service Binding Operator also makes it easy to experiment with these technologies by running our Managed Kafka sandbox activity in an existing OpenShift cluster on AWS.
Finally; if you have already created the Sandbox Activity in our sandbox, and want to move it to your AWS cluster, check out the GitOps Primer Operator, which gives you the ability to export all Kubernetes objects within a namespace as a portable zip file that can be easily taken to another cluster.
Happy coding!

The story of a reused Go error variable
A user opened a new issue to ACME Corporation because he noticed that users could enter any string into the phone number on the contact form. Wile E. is in charge of implementing a fix.
Wile E. examines the code:

the existence of yet another new operating system, called KataOS, aimed at
the creation of secure embedded systems.


	As the foundation for this new operating system, we chose seL4 as
	the microkernel because it puts security front and center; it is
	mathematically proven secure, with guaranteed confidentiality,
	integrity, and availability. Through the seL4 CAmkES framework,
	we're also able to provide statically-defined and analyzable system
	components. KataOS provides a verifiably-secure platform that
	protects the user's privacy because it is logically impossible for
	applications to breach the kernel's hardware security protections
	and the system components are verifiably secure. KataOS is also
	implemented almost entirely in Rust, which provides a strong
	starting point for software security, since it eliminates entire
	classes of bugs, such as off-by-one errors and buffer overflows.]]></summary>

the 6.1 release, but one of the changes that has received the most
attention will also have the least short-term effect for users of the
kernel: the introduction of support for the Rust programming language.  No
system with a production 6.1 kernel will be running any Rust code, but this
change does give kernel developers a chance to play with the language in
the kernel context and get a sense for how Rust development feels.  Perhaps
the most likely conclusion for most developers, though, will be that there

It would be best if you packaged Java applications as Helm charts containing all of the necessary metadata and resource definitions to configure them for distribution through Helm. This article introduces the Dekorate Helm extension as an easier way to generate and maintain Helm chart resources.
What are Helm charts?
A Helm chart is a collection of files inside a directory. The following files are mandatory:
Chart.yaml: Chart metadata, such as name, version, and developers.
values.yaml: Default configuration values for the chart in YAML.
templates: A directory containing the list of resources that, combined with values.yaml, generate the application when the chart is installed. The resou…]]></summary>

Dandelions (full rules), an asymmetric paper-and-pencil game
invented by the book’s author, Ben Orlin. Just as with British Square two
years ago — and essentially following the same technique — I wrote a
program that explores the game tree sufficiently to play either side
perfectly, “solving” the game in its standard 5-by-5 configuration.
The source: dandelions.c

The article also introduced the Kryptonite for Kafka project, which integrates with Apache Kafka Connect to achieve automatic encryption and decryption with no changes to application code.
This article, the second and last in this series, contains more advanced examples that cover a common scenario: File-based data integration between different kinds of storage. I'll show Kryptonite for Kafka features that support fine-grained, field-level encryption in this use case.
To keep things simple in the examples, a local file system serves as the source while the sink is set up in MinIO (Figure 1), an open source object storage service compatible with AWS S3.

At last week’s Made by Google launch event, we announced several new hardware products including the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro, Google Pixel Watch, and Google Pixel Tablet—a suite of innovative products that we’re excited about. While sure to delight users, it got me thinking—what will these changes mean for developers? 
It’s hard to build experiences that let users enjoy the best that their devices have to offer. Undoubtedly this brings a level of complexity for developers who will need to build and test against multiple OS updates and new features. That’s the thing about development—the environment is constantly evolving. We want to cut through the complexity and make it simpler to choose the technology you use, whether for an app o…]]></summary>
