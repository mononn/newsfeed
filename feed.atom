Google has updated its Passes API to enable a simple and secure way to store and access COVID vaccination and test cards on Android devices. Starting today, developers from  healthcare organizations, government agencies and organizations authorized by public health authorities to distribute COVID vaccines and/or tests will have access to these APIs to create a digital version of COVID vaccination or test information. This will roll out initially in the United States followed by other countries.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over at the Project Zero blog, Felix Wilhelm posted a lengthy account of a vulnerability he found in the Linux kernel's KVM (Kernel-based virtual machine) subsystem:

In this blog post I describe a vulnerability in KVM’s AMD-specific code and discuss how this bug can be turned into a full virtual machine escape. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first public writeup of a KVM guest-to-host breakout that does not rely on bugs in user space components such as QEMU. The discussed bug was assigned CVE-2021-29657, affects kernel versions v5.10-rc1 to v5.12-rc6 and was patched at the end of March 2021. As the bug only became exploitable in v5.10 and was discovered roughly 5 months later, most real world deployments of KVM should not be affected. I still think the issue is an interesting case study in the work required to build a stable guest-to-host escape against KVM and hope that this writeup can strengthen the case that hypervisor compromises are not only theoretical issues.]]></summary>

incredible piece of software engineering. This is apparent when

 The Google Identity team is continually working to improve Google Account security and create a safer and more secure experience for our users. As part of that work, we recently introduced a new secure browser policy prohibiting Google OAuth requests in embedded browser libraries commonly referred to as embedded webviews. All embedded webviews will be blocked starting on September 30, 2021. 
Embedded webview libraries are problematic because they allow a nefarious developer to intercept and alter communications between Google and its users by acting as a "man in the middle."

With 1,600 students by his side, Jack Lee grew the largest Google Developer Student Club in the world in just 6 months at the London School of Economics (LSE). A life-long athlete, who loves leading teams, Jack saw that reigniting his university’s GDSC would be a great opportunity to have a large impact on the local tech scene. With a heavy focus on partnerships, Jack connected members of his club with leaders at top companies and other student groups across Scotland, France, Norway, Canada, and Nigeria. These collaborations enabled students to practice networking, while gaining access to key internships.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I wrote a cute little program for doing Turtle Graphics.  For those of you who don't know, turtle graphics were originally added to the LOGO language by Seymour Papert in the late 1960s.  He built a robot that he called a "turtle" that could hold a pen.  The robot had wheels and could move forwards and backwards, and could rotate left and right.  It could also raise and lower the pen.  When placed on a sheet of paper, the turtle could be commanded to draw interesting designs.
Papert's goal was to teach children about programming.  As the years went by the robot got replaced with screens, and the turtle became an icon that could draw lines.  Children from the 70s until now have been enthralled by the simple commands for directing the turtle, and the elegant drawings they can make.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The KernelCI continuous-integration project held
its first hackfest recently.  Developers from the KernelCI team,
Google, and Collabora worked to improve many different aspects of KernelCI
testing capabilities.  There are plans for more hackfests.

The first-ever KernelCI hackfest was a success. It kicked off the work to enable kernel testing through Chromium OS, a product-specific userspace. Enabling full userspace images and real-world tests like video call simulations adds a lot of complexity to the testing process. However, the benefits are a clear win for the community. They allow a more thorough kernel testing and validation through real application use cases, which can exercise several different kernel areas at the same time in an organized manner. Generally, it is not simple for lower-level kernel test suites like kselftests or LTP to orchestrate a similar use case.]]></summary>

 Lorena Locks is on a mission to grow the LGBTQIA+ tech community in Brazil. Her inspiration came from hosting Google Developer Group (GDG) Floripa meetups with her friend Catarina, where they were able to identify a need in their community.  
     
“We felt there wasn't a forum to meet people in the tech industry that reflected ourselves. So we decided to think bigger.”

Pride Week at GDG Floripa and Belo Horizonte, Brazil 
  
As a Women Techmakers Ambassador and Google Developer Group lead in Floripa, Brazil,  Lorena worked with the local community to create a week of special events, including over 12 talks and sessions centered on empowering the LGBTQIA+ experience in tech.  
The events took place every night at 7pm from June 21st - 25th and focused on creating inclusive representation and building trust among developer communities.  
     
Lorena’s commitment to this underrepresented group gained the attention of many local leaders in tech who identify as LGBTQIA+ and volunteered as speakers during Pride Week.
     
By creating spaces to talk about important LGBTQIA+ topics in tech, Pride Week events included sessions on: 
 
Spotting binary designs in products  
How to build inclusive tech teams  
Being an LGBTQIA+ manager   
Developing 'Nohs Somos' an app for the LGBTQIA+ community  
The best practices for D&I   
General Personal Data Protection Law and inclusive gender questions on forms 
  

 
  Speakers in photo: Lorena Locks and Catarina Schein  
  
With one-hundred percent of the speakers at these events coming from the LGTBQIA+ community, Pride Week at GDG Floripa and Belo Horizonte was a high impact program that has gone on to inspire GDGs around the world.

Of course, if the last week was small and calm, 5.13 overall is
actually fairly large. In fact, it's one of the bigger 5.x releases,
with over 16k commits (over 17k if you count merges), from over 2k
developers. But it's a 'big all over' kind of thing, not something
particular that stands out as particularly unusual.




Headline features in this release include
the "misc" group controller,
multiple
sources for trusted keys,
kernel
stack randomization on every system call,
support for Clang control-flow integrity
enforcement,
the ability to call kernel functions
directly from BPF programs,
minor-fault
handling for userfaultfd(),
the removal of /dev/kmem,
the Landlock security module,
and, of course, thousands of cleanups and fixes.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over on the Mozilla blog, the company has announced a new platform, Mozilla Rally, that "puts users in control of their data and empowers them to contribute their browsing data to crowdfund projects for a better Internet and a better society".  Rally comes out of work that Mozilla did with Professor Jonathan Mayer's research group at Princeton University .

Your data is valuable. But for too long, online services have pilfered, swapped, and exploited your data without your awareness. Privacy violations and filter bubbles are all consequences of a surveillance data economy. But what if, instead of companies taking your data without giving you a say, you could select who gets access to your data and put it to work for public good?

[...] By leveraging the scale of web browsers – a piece of software used by billions of people around the world – Rally has the potential to help address societal problems we could not solve before. Our goal is to demonstrate that there is a case for an equitable market for data, one where every party is treated fairly, and we welcome mission-aligned organizations that want to join us on this journey.]]></summary>

 The Google for Startups Accelerator: Women Founders program is now open for applications until July 19.
Last year, we launched the inaugural Google for Startups Accelerator: Women Founders program in North America to help women-led startups identify and solve technical challenges while scaling their companies. The inaugural cohort also received tailored programming to address some of the longstanding barriers that women founders face.  
Women founders remain underrepresented in the tech startup ecosystem because they often lack access to the resources needed to start, build, and grow their businesses. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated these structural barriers by disproportionately impacting women in the workforce—and research shows women were more vulnerable to the economic effects of COVID-19 because of existing gender disparities.    
For women founders, access to capital is one of the major challenges to launching their business.  A recent report showed women-led startups received a mere 2.3% of global venture capitalist funding in 2020, falling from 2.8% the year before.  
The Google for Startups Accelerator: Women Founders program aims to help bridge the gap and create opportunities for women founders to succeed.  Beyond mentorship and technical project support, the accelerator also includes deep dives and workshops focused on product design, customer acquisition, and leadership development for founders. Participants will also hear from a roster of speakers and facilitators who deliver both technical and nontechnical programming for women-led startups.  
Applications for the second Google for Startups Accelerator: Women Founders program are now open until July 19, for North American applicants. Approximately 10-12 startups with at least one woman founder will be selected from across North America. The accelerator runs from September through to December 2021.

so far, the focus has been on providing better
tools that can streamline the usual email-based workflow.  But that
"email-based" part has proven to be problematic for some potential
contributors, especially those who might want to simply submit a small bug
fix and are not interested in getting set up with that workflow.  The
project-hosting "forge" sites, like GitHub and GitLab, provide a nearly
frictionless path for these kinds of one-off contributions, but they do
not mesh well—at all, really—with most of mainline kernel development.

works, this
blog entry from Patrick Louis should be of interest.
"The session manager is the piece of software that is responsible for the policy: to find and configure devices, attach them appropriately to the graph, set and restore their properties if needed, route streams to the right device, set their volume, and more.
It can create it’s own objects in the PipeWire graph related to session management such as endpoints and links between them, a sort of abstraction on top of PipeWire nodes.

There are currently two implementations of the session manager:
pipewire-media session and WirePlumber."]]></summary>

 Other key updates include support for Magento 2.4 as well as Magento 2.3. Easy to download and install without any coding, Google Pay for Magento provides fast, frictionless checkout and allows consumers to use already-stored payment credentials. This reduces data entry errors and translates to higher conversion rates and larger average order size for merchants.

community has pursued a policy of legal ambiguity and technical

So in this post I'd like to quickly discuss how to implement basic authentication correctly in your Go applications.
We'll start with a bit of background information, but if you're not interested in that you can skip straight to the code.
What is basic authentication? When should I use it?
As a developer, you're probably already familiar with the prompt that web browsers show when you visit a URL that's protected by basic authentication.

When you input a username and password into this prompt, the web browser will send a HTTP r…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my favorite things about the recent Go 1.16 release is a small — but very welcome — addition to the flag package: the flag.Func() function. This makes it much easier to define and use custom command-line flags in your application.
For example, if you want to parse a flag like --pause=10s directly into a time.Duration type,  or parse --urls="http://example.com http://example.org" directly into a []string slice, then previously you had two options. You could either create a custom type to implement the flag.Value interface, or use a third-party package like pflag.
But now the flag.Func() function gives you a simple and lightweight alternative. In this short post we're going to take a look at a few examples of how you can use it in your own code.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Prossimo project has announced
that it has contracted with Miguel Ojeda to work on Rust in the Linux kernel
for the next year.  Prossimo is a new name for the memory-safety
projects being run by the Internet Security Research
Group (ISRG), which is the organization behind the Let's Encrypt certificate authority
(CA) project.  Google provided the funds to enable Ojeda to work full-time
on the project starting back in April.


The Linux kernel is at the heart of the modern Internet, from
servers to client devices. It’s on the front line for processing network
data and other forms of input. As such, vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel
can have a wide-ranging impact, putting security and privacy for people,
organizations, and devices at risk. Since it’s written largely in the C
language, which is not memory-safe, memory safety vulnerabilities such as
buffer overflows and use-after-frees are a constant concern. By making it
possible to write parts of the Linux kernel in Rust, which is memory-safe,
we can entirely eliminate memory safety vulnerabilities from certain
components, such as drivers.


We have previously covered another
Prossimo project, which provides funding for
Rustls development, as well as Ojeda's work
on Rust in the kernel.]]></summary>

Chat bots can also be used in direct messages, offering a new way to optimize workflows and personal productivity, such as managing project tasks or reporting time activity.

 A little over 10 years ago, we launched the IT Residency Program (ITRP) at Google with a twofold mission: to provide exceptional tech support for Googlers and to empower the next generation of IT pioneers.  
ITRP’s founding principle is learning and development. In addition to formal on-the-job IT support training, the program takes its residents through a focused career development path, including a hands-on rotation in a specific Google function in their chosen specialty. For their part, the residents, who come from a wide spectrum of often non-traditional backgrounds, bring with them a passion for learning. ITRP converts that passion into real-world experience and equips them for a lifelong career in tech.
