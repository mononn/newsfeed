distribution is focused on gaming, naturally, but the effort to build it
has resulted 
in contributions to multiple areas in the Linux ecosystem.  Alberto Garcia
has been working on SteamOS and came to Bilbao, Spain to describe some of those
contributions at Open Source Summit Europe 2023.  There are some obvious
areas where a gaming-focused OS might contribute upstream, such as
graphics, but the talk showed contributions in several other areas as well.]]></summary>

Artificial intelligence (AI) represents a new frontier for technology we are just beginning to explore. While many of you are interested in working with AI, we realize that most developers aren't ready to dive into building their own artificial intelligence models (yet). With this in mind, we've created resources to get you started building applications with this technology.
Today, we are launching a new video series called Build with Google AI. This series features practical, useful AI-powered projects that don't require deep knowledge of artificial intelligence, or huge development resources. In fact, you can get these projects working in less than a day.

Note that as of JDK 21, both Structured Concurrency and Scoped Values are in Preview state and so cannot really be used in production applications.
With this limitation in mind, let's start by looking at the patterns that are enabled by virtual threads alone—​which can, therefore, be used without restriction in Java 21 applications.

kernel code that is executing long-running instructions led to a deeper

supported preemption modes, varying from "none" (kernel code is never
preemptible) to realtime (where the kernel is almost always preemptible).
Making better use of the kernel's preemption machinery looked like a
possible solution to the immediate problem, but it seems that there are
better options in store.  In short, kernel developers would like to give

Imagine the ideal Ansible development experience: there should be seamless access to testing tools, linters, a user-friendly integrated development environment (IDE) experience, and integration with source control.

article demonstrates a technique for building bespoke hash maps that
compose nicely with arena allocation. In addition, they’re fast, simple,

arenas and to simplify implementation — they have slightly above average
memory requirements. The design, which we’re calling a hash-trie, is the
result of fruitful collaboration with NRK, whose sibling article
includes benchmarks. It’s my new favorite data structure, and has proven
incredibly useful. With a couple well-placed acquire/release atomics, we
can even turn it into a lock-free concurrent hash map.

Either way, the vulnerabilities are now disclosed, but patches are not yet

This month, Google Search turns 25. A lot has changed over the last quarter of a century when it comes to the development space, but one thing has remained a constant - whether you’re stuck on a problem, reading documentation, learning about new technology, or figuring out the best tech stack for your project, Search has been a helpful tool in getting your questions answered. 
What you searched for is a strong signal when it comes to developer trends across web, mobile, cloud, and AI over the years.  Let’s take a look at some of the interesting things you’ve looked up* – and some funny queries too – because everyone loves a good retrospective.

It's a daemonless container engine (doesn't require a daemon to be running in the background), can be used in rootless mode, and is compatible with Docker (due to the Open Container Initiative). Now with Podman Desktop, it's even easier to work with your images and containers, giving you a powerful desktop GUI that supports both Podman and Docker!
While the open source project is available on Linux and macOS, let's take a look at how to install and use Podman Desktop on Windows. This tutorial walks through the following steps:

Partly, it's the programming languages, which were designed way back when one processor was the default. Mostly, though, it's because programmers aren't good at writing software where things can happen in any order or at any time.
In this article, we'll examine two examples of failed concurrency assumptions in the form of two programs from glibc's test suite that weren't operating reliably.
Ready! Go! Set!
Consider this first example, which has been simplified:

Over the past year I’ve refined my approach to arena allocation.
With practice, it’s effective, simple, and fast; typically as easy to use
as garbage collection but without the costs. Depending on need, an
allocator can weigh just 7–25 lines of code — perfect when lacking a
runtime. With the core details of my own technique settled, now is a
good time to document and share lessons learned. This is certainly not the
only way to approach arena allocation, but these are practices I’ve worked
out to simplify programs and reduce mistakes.
An arena is a memory buffer and an offset into that buffer, initially
zero. To allocate an object, grab a pointer at the offset, advance the
offset by the size of the object, and return the pointer. There’s a little

The user still had to decide on the number of shards they wanted to have running. To make this an informed decision, users needed to consider the number of managed clusters per shard.
Although this functionality helps define the number of replicas of Argo CD application controllers needed, it does not necessarily end up having the optimal use of the compute resources across all shards. For example, setting 2 shards may be too small for handling 10 clusters, while setting 50 shards will leave 40 shards unused and still consume the assigned compute resources.

"free, cross-platform, easy-to-use electronic design automation suite to draw schematics and design printed circuit boards".    
As noted in a blog post back in May, a grant has helped spur development of the tool.  
The focus for the release has been in adding features that were needed so that "there should be no show stopper anymore which prevents you from using LibrePCB for more complex PCB [printed circuit board] designs".  
New features include a 3D viewer and export format for working with designs in a mechanical computer aided design (CAD) tool, support for manufacturer part number (MFN) management, and lots of board editor features such as 
thermal relief pads in planes, blind & buried vias,
keepout zones, and more. [Thanks to Alphonse Ogulla.]]]></summary>

It is designed to generate human-like text based on the input it receives. However, there are alternatives. Some open source options are meant to run locally/on-premises instead of in a hosted solution, making them perfect for controlling your data so that it doesn't go outside your boundaries or out of your control.
One of these projects is GPT4All. GPT4All is an ecosystem to train and deploy powerful and customized large language models (LLM) that run locally on a standard machine with no special features, such as a GPU.
This article will demonstrate how to integrate GPT4All into a Quarkus application so that you can query this service and return a response without any …]]></summary>

There are also some interesting features in the preview for JDK 21, such as string templates, scoped values, and structured concurrency. This article highlights six new features in this release.
Virtual threads
Java's traditional threading model can quickly become an expensive operation if the application creates more threads than the operating system (OS) can handle. Also, in cases where the thread lifecycle is not long, the cost of creating a thread is high.
Enter virtual threads, which solve this problem by mapping Java threads to carrier thread…]]></summary>

Introduction

In December 2022, Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) discovered an in-the-wild exploit chain targeting Samsung Android devices. TAG’s blog post covers the targeting and the actor behind the campaign. This is a technical analysis of the final stage of one of the exploit chains, specifically CVE-2023-0266 (a 0-day in the ALSA compatibility layer) and CVE-2023-26083 (a 0-day in the Mali GPU driver) as well as the techniques used by the attacker to gain kernel arbitrary read/write access.

Notably, all of the previous stages of the exploit chain used n-day vulnerabilities:


CVE-2022-4262, a vulnerability patched in Chrome that was unpatched in the Samsung browser (i.e. a "Chrome n-day"), was used to achieve RCE.

https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3120rc3/
 
This is the second release candidate of Python 3.12.0
This release, 3.12.0rc3, is the absolutely last release preview for Python 3.12.
There will be no ABI changes from this point forward
 in the 3.12 series. The intent is for the final release of 3.12.0, 
scheduled for Monday, 2023-10-02, to be identical to this release 
candidate. This really is the last chance to find critical problems in Python 3.12.
Call to action
We strongly encourage maintainers of third-party Python projects to 
prepare their projects for 3.12 compatibilities during this phase, and 
where necessary publish Python 3.12 wheels on PyPI to be ready for the 
final release of 3.12.0. Any bin…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Learn how the overload pattern works for std::variant visitation and how it changed with C++20 and C++23.
While I was doing research for my book and blog posts about C++17 several times, I stumbled upon this pattern for visitation of std::variant:
template<class... Ts> struct overload : Ts... { using Ts::operator()...; };
template<class... Ts> overload(Ts...) -> overload<Ts...>;


With the above pattern, you can provide separate lambdas “in-place” for visitation.
It’s just two lines of compact C++ code but packs some exciting techniques.
Let’s see how this works and go through the three new C++17 features that make this pattern possible.

We are thrilled to announce our latest cohort of the Google for Startups Accelerator: Black Founders program as it embarks on its fourth year serving Black founders in the U.S. and Canada.
The 12 companies selected for this year’s cohort reflect the trends of the broader application pool -  startups focused on improving healthcare outcomes,  protecting the environment,  reducing consumer energy consumption, and removing  barriers to financial resources and home ownership (just to name a few). Additionally, these companies are utilizing emerging AI technologies to streamline and simplify customer, consumer, and professional experiences at all levels.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm pleased to announce the release of Python 3.12 release candidate 2.

https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3120rc2/
 
This is the second release candidate of Python 3.12.0
This release, 3.12.0rc2, is the last release preview for Python 3.12.
There will be no ABI changes from this point forward
 in the 3.12 series. The intent is for the final release of 3.12.0, 
scheduled for Monday, 2023-10-02, to be identical to this release 
candidate. This is the last chance to find critical problems in Python 3.12.
Call to action
We strongly encourage maintainers of third-party Python projects to 
prepare their projects for 3.12 compatibilities during this phase, and 
where necessary publish Python 3.12 wheels on PyPI to be ready for the 
final release of 3.12.0. Any binary wheels built a…]]></summary>

To celebrate the 45th anniversary of “SPACE INVADERS,” we collaborated with TAITO, the Japanese developer of the original arcade game, and UNIT9 to launch “SPACE INVADERS: World Defense,” an immersive game that takes advantage of the most advanced location-based AR technology. Players around the world can go outside to explore their local neighborhoods, defend the Earth from virtual Space Invaders that spawn from nearby structures, and score points by taking them down – all with augmented reality. 
The game is powered by our latest ARCore technology - Geospatial API, Streetscape Geometry API, and Geospatial Creator. We’re excited to show you behind the scenes o…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In September last year, a breach at LastPass’ parent company GoTo (formerly LogMeIn) culminated in attackers siphoning out all data from their servers. The criticism from the security community has been massive. This was not so much because of the breach itself, such things happen, but because of the many obvious ways in which LastPass made matters worse: taking months to notify users, failing to provide useful mitigation instructions, downplaying the severity of the attack, ignoring technical issues which have been publicized years ago and made the attackers’ job much easier. The list goes on.
Now this has been almost a year ago. LastPass promised to improve, both as far as their communication goes and on the technical side of things. So let’s take a look at whether they managed to delive…]]></summary>
