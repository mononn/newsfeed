        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in June, we looked at a change to
Python annotations, which provide a way to associate metadata, such as type
information, with functions. That change
was planned for the upcoming Python 3.10 release, but was deferred due to
questions about it and its impact on run-time uses of the feature.
The Python steering council felt
that  more time was needed to consider all of the different aspects of the
problem before deciding on the right approach; the feature freeze for Python 3.10 was only
around two weeks off when the decision was announced on April 20.  But now, there is most of a year
before another feature freeze, which gives the council (and the greater
Python development community) some time to discuss it at a more leisurely pace.]]></summary>

 An optional migration
  
Serverless Migration Station is a video mini-series from Serverless Expeditions focused on helping developers modernize their applications running on a serverless compute platform from Google Cloud. Previous episodes demonstrated how to migrate away from the older, legacy App Engine (standard environment) services to newer Google Cloud standalone equivalents like Cloud Datastore. Today's product crossover episode differs slightly from that by migrating away from App Engine altogether, containerizing those apps for Cloud Run. 
There's little question the industry has been moving towards containerization as an application deployment mechanism over the past decade. However, Docker and use of containe…]]></summary>

Layer Security (TLS) encryption is ubiquitous on today's internet,
though that has largely happened over the last 20 years or so;  the first
public version of its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), appeared in
1995.  Before then, internet protocols were generally not encrypted, thus providing
fertile ground for various types of "meddler-in-the-middle" (MitM) attacks.
Later on, the
STARTTLS command was added to some protocols as a
backward-compatible way to add TLS support, but the mechanism has suffered from a
number of flaws and vulnerabilities over the years.  Some recent research,
going by the name "NO STARTTLS",  describes more, similar
vulnerabilities and concludes that it is probably time to avoid using
STARTTLS altogether.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Go blog has announced the release of version 1.17 of the Go programming language.  The new version has some fairly small changes to the language, support for the Arm 64-bit architecture on Windows, along with other features, bug fixes, and more:


This release brings additional improvements to the compiler, namely a new way of passing function arguments and results. This change has shown about a 5% performance improvement in Go programs and reduction in binary sizes of around 2% for amd64 platforms. Support for more platforms will come in future releases.

August Asahi Linux progress report is out.


	Instead, a much safer approach that has been used by projects such

	that the official drivers perform on a real system, without
	actually looking at the code. Nouveau accomplished this by using a
	Linux driver to intercept accesses by Nvidia’s official Linux
	driver. Of course, Apple’s M1 drivers are for macOS, not
	Linux. While we could implement the same approach with a custom
	patch to the open source core of the macOS kernel, we decided

In this blog post, I’ll show you the new rules that we got in C++17 that made this complicated term much simpler and practical.
Here are the main points for today:
What’s the case with make_unique vs unique_ptr<T>(new T) in a function call.
What are the new rules for C++17?
Are all bugs fixed and now well defined?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Debian 11, codenamed "bullseye", has been released after just over two years of development.  It has lots of updates, including to half a dozen different desktop environments, lots of tools and programming languages, and, of course, more. It is available for nine different architectures. 

This release contains over 11,294 new packages for a total count of
59,551 packages, along with a significant reduction of over 9,519
packages which were marked as "obsolete" and removed. 42,821 packages
were updated and 5,434 packages remained unchanged.

"bullseye" becomes our first release to provide a Linux kernel with
support for the exFAT filesystem and defaults to using it for mount
exFAT filesystems. Consequently it is no longer required to use the
filesystem-in-userspace implementation provided via the exfat-fuse
package. Tools for creating and checking an exFAT filesystem are
provided in the exfatprogs package.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The KDE project has announced the release of KDE Gear 21.08, which updates the over 200 apps that are part of the project.  The announcement highlights updates in many of the desktop tools that KDE Plasma users are accustomed to, including the Okular document viewer, the Dolphin file manager, Elisa music player, and Gwenview image viewer.  The Konsole terminal application got updated as well:

Text terminals are intimidating to people who are new to Linux. But knowing just a bit about how to use them (no, you don’t need to know how to program) gives you a level of control over your machine difficult to achieve any other way.

This is doubly true when using Konsole, KDE’s very powerful spin on the classic text terminal. In fact, calling Konsole a “terminal emulator” and leaving it at that is not fair. Take Konsole’s preview feature, for example, type white, red, blue or salmon at the command line, hover the cursor over the word, and a box will appear displaying the color. You can also use HTML color codes, like #1d99f3 and get a preview of the KDE blue color.

Previews extend to images and folders: hover the cursor over an image filename in a list in Konsole and a thumbnail will pop up showing you a preview. Hovering over a folder will show you a preview of its contents. This is very useful when you want to make sure you are copying, moving, or erasing the right thing.]]></summary>

considered to be a trusted part of the system.  This faith has been under
assault for some time, though, and it fails entirely in some situations,
including virtual machines that do not trust the host system they are
running under.  The recently covered virtio-hardening work is one response to this
situation, but that only addresses a small portion of the drivers built
into a typical kernel.  What is to be done about the rest?  The driver-filter

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Linux Foundation has announced the formation of the eBPF Foundation:


Founding members include Facebook, Google, Isovalent, Microsoft and Netflix. This comes in advance of the eBPF Summit, a free and virtual event taking place August 18-19, 2021.

eBPF allows developers to safely and efficiently embed programs in any piece of software, including the operating system kernel. As a result, eBPF is quickly becoming the method of choice for achieving a wide range of infrastructure use cases, delivering significant efficiency and performance gains and dramatically reducing the complexity of the system. For example, Facebook is using eBPF as the primary software-defined load balancer in its data centers, and Google is using Cilium to bring eBPF-based networking and security to the managed Kubernetes offerings GKE and Anthos.

[...] The eBPF Foundation will expand the significant level of contributions being made to extend the powerful capabilities of eBPF and grow beyond Linux. It will be the home for open source eBPF projects and technologies and nurture the community through a variety of activities, including summits and other collaboration events in order to further drive the growth and adoption of the eBPF ecosystem.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Child pornography and other types of sexual abuse of children are unquestionably
heinous crimes; those who participate in them should be caught and severely
punished.  But some recent efforts to combat these scourges have gone a good
ways down the path toward a kind of AI-driven digital panopticon that will
invade the privacy of everyone in order to try to catch people who are
violating laws prohibiting those activities. It is thus no surprise that privacy
advocates are up in arms about an Apple  plan to scan iPhone messages and
an EU measure
to allow companies to scan private messages, both looking 
for "child sexual abuse material" (CSAM).  As with many things of this
nature, there are concerns about the collateral damage that these efforts will
cause—not to mention the slippery slope that is being created.]]></summary>

 As Google Workspace is redefining the future of team collaboration and Google Chat Rooms evolve into Spaces, webhooks are a useful feature that already exists in the current Chat rooms of today that allow you to deliver asynchronous messages directly into Chat rooms where users work. Webhooks in Chat are powerful and simple to use.  Unlike the more well known Chatbots, which are applications built specifically for interacting synchronously with users using the Google Chat API, webhooks enable asynchronous messaging into Google Chat from applications that aren't bots themselves. In this post, we’ll explore using webhooks in Chat and demonstrate a real world use case from our work internally at Google.

guests, and must
protect itself from potentially malicious guests. With initiatives
like confidential computing, this rule is extended in the other direction: the
guest no longer trusts the host. This change of paradigm requires
adding boundary defenses in places where there have been none before.
Recently, Andi Kleen submitted a patch

that resulted from this patch set highlighted the need to secure

covered here since February 2020.  In the
beginning, it was a  flag to memfd_create(),
but its functionality was later moved to a separate system call.  There
have been many changes during this feature's development, but its core
purpose remains the 
same: allow a user-space process to create a range of memory that is
inaccessible to anybody else — kernel included.  That memory can be used to
store cryptographic keys or any other data that must not be exposed to
others.  This new system call was finally merged for the upcoming 5.14
release; what follows is a look at the form this call will take in the
mainline kernel.]]></summary>

 An optional migration
 Serverless Migration Station is a mini-series from Serverless Expeditions focused on helping users on one of Google Cloud's serverless compute platforms modernize their applications. The video today demonstrates how to migrate a sample app from Cloud NDB (or App Engine ndb) to Cloud Datastore. While Cloud NDB suffices as a current solution for today's App Engine developers, this optional migration is for those who want to consolidate their app code to using a single client library to talk to Datastore. 
  
Cloud Datastore started as Google App Engine's original database but matured to becoming its own standalone product in 2013. At that time, native client libraries were created for the new product so…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over on the Google Security Blog, Kees Cook describes his vision for approaches to assuring kernel security in a more collaborative way. He sees a number of areas where companies could work together to make it easier for everyone to use recent kernels rather than redundantly backporting fixes to older kernel versions.  It will take more engineers working on things like testing and its infrastructure, security tool development, toolchain improvements for security, and boosting the number of kernel maintainers:

Long-term Linux robustness depends on developers, but especially on effective kernel maintainers. Although there is effort in the industry to train new developers, this has been traditionally justified only by the "feature driven" jobs they can get. But focusing only on product timelines ultimately leads Linux into the Tragedy of the Commons. Expanding the number of maintainers can avoid it. Luckily the "pipeline" for new maintainers is straightforward.

Maintainers are built not only from their depth of knowledge of a subsystem's technology, but also from their experience with mentorship of other developers and code review. Training new reviewers must become the norm, motivated by making upstream review part of the job. Today's reviewers become tomorrow's maintainers. If each major kernel subsystem gained four more dedicated maintainers, we could double productivity.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On his blog, Colin Watson has a lengthy reflection on moving the code for Ubuntu's Launchpad software-collaboration web application from Python 2 to Python 3. He looks at some of the problem areas for upgrading, both in general and for Launchpad specifically, some pain points that were encountered, lessons learned, and the nine known regressions that reached the Launchpad production code during the process.  
2to3 was entirely impractical in most non-trivial cases and wasn't what most people ended up doing, and yet the idea that 2to3 is all you need still floats around Stack Overflow and the like as a result.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The C strcpy function is a common sight in typical C programs.
It’s also a source of buffer overflow defects, so linters and code
reviewers commonly recommend alternatives such as strncpy
(difficult to use correctly; mismatched semantics), strlcpy
(non-standard), or C11’s optional strcpy_s (no correct or practical
implementations). Besides their individual shortcomings, these
answers are incorrect. strcpy and friends are, at best, incredibly
niche, and the correct replacement is memcpy.
If strcpy is not easily replaced with memcpy then the code is
fundamentally wrong. Either it’s not using strcpy safely or it’s doing
something dumb and should be rewritten. Highlighting such problems is part
of what makes memcpy such an effective replacement.

that lead to buffer overflows and a seemingly endless stream of security
vulnerabilities.  But, even in C, it is possible to improve the
situation in many cases.  One of those is the memcpy() family of
functions, which are used to efficiently copy or overwrite blocks of
memory; with a bit of help from the compiler, those functions can be
prevented from writing past the end of the
destination object they are passed.  Enforcing that condition in the kernel
is harder than one might expect, though, as this
massive patch set from Kees Cook shows.]]></summary>

interested in using Copilot wonder if the code snippets and other elements

However, it’s relatively uncommon for this to occur right in the middle of summer! As you can guess, the car wouldn’t start this morning and I had no idea that it … Continue reading Is It a Bug or Feature?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Filesystem developers tend to disagree with each other about many things,
but they are nearly unanimous in their dislike for the truncate()
system call, which chops data off the end of a file.  Implementing
truncate() tends to be full of traps for the unwary — the kind of
traps that can lead to lost data.  But it turns out that a similar
operation, called "hole punching", may be worse.  This operation has been
subject to difficult-to-hit but real race conditions in many filesystems
for years; this
patch set from Jan Kara may finally be at a point where it can fill the
hole in hole punching.]]></summary>

process are nothing new for free-software projects; there is clearly a lot
more interest in creating new features (and the bugs that go with them, of

like CPython, though, the backlog can seriously impede progress—potentially
chasing off contributors whose work falls through the cracks.  In order
to address that, the Python Software Foundation (PSF) has
raised some funds to hire
Łukasz Langa as the CPython "Developer-in-Residence".  Langa will be

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The annual Linux Plumbers Conference (LPC) is a gathering of a relatively
small subset of the developers working on the low-level (plumbing) details
of Linux systems.  It covers topics from below the kernel through the user-space
components that underlie the interfaces and applications that most Linux
users interact with.  This year's event will be held
virtually September 20‑24; it is shaping up to be another
great edition of one of the premier open-registration Linux technical conferences on the

Samuel Mugisha has been very busy since we first shared his story in 2019. Back then, Samuel was a university student from Uganda who was inspired to create a mobile Immunization Calculator app to help keep track of children’s vaccinations after he saw his community using handwritten paper cards that were difficult to read and keep intact. Samuel kicked his idea into gear by forming a team with friends from GDSC Muni University, and they ended up winning the 2019 Google Developer Student Clubs Solution Challenge. The Solution Challenge is an annual event hosted by Google developers, inviting students from all over the world to develop solutions for local community problems using Google technology.…]]></summary>

      executives they hear how the executives have a suite of aging applications

      3rd parties and with inflexible contracts. These applications are critical
      to the successful operation of the business, while at the same time being
      one of the largest sources of business and operational risk.
One approach in this situation is to try to minimize the impact of
      replacement on the broader organization by 'simply' replacing the
      technology while leaving everything else 'as is'. Whilst Feature Parity
      often sounds like a reasonable proposition, we have learnt the hard way
      that people greatly underestimate the effort required, and thus misjudge
      the choice between this and the other alternatives.

much memory is installed in a system, it is never enough.  This is
especially true of systems with tight performance constraints, where every
page of memory is allocated and in use, making it difficult to find
more when it is badly needed.  One way to make more memory
available is to kill one or more processes, freeing their resources for
other users.  But that often does not work as quickly or reliably as users
would like.  In an attempt to improve the situation, Suren Baghdasaryan has

that is to more aggressively reclaim memory that is not being used.  To
that end, DAMON author SeongJae Park is proposing a

 Last year, 12 inspiring entrepreneurs kicked off the inaugural Google for Startups Accelerator for Black Founders. Throughout the three month program, founders met weekly to work on growing their startups and solving tough technical challenges. “There’s so much happening every single day as a startup,” says Ashley Edwards, founder of MindRight Health, whose startup is making mental healthcare accessible to people of color and low-income families. “The program helped us navigate everything from protecting our team from distractions to building out our machine learning and data science models.”

by Qualys on July 20.  A full system compromise is possible until
the kernel is patched (or mitigations that may not be fully effective are applied).  At
its core, the vulnerability relies on a path through the kernel where
64-bit size_t values are "converted" to signed integers, which effectively
results in an overflow.  The flaw was reported to Red Hat  on June 9,
along with a local
systemd
denial-of-service vulnerability, leading to a kernel crash, found at the same time.
Systems with untrusted local users need updates for both problems applied as soon as
they are available—out of
an abundance of caution, other systems likely should be updated as well.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Stockfish project, which
distributes a chess engine under GPLv3, has announced
the filing of a GPL-enforcement lawsuit against ChessBase, which has been
(and evidently still is) distributing proprietary versions of the Stockfish
code.


	In the past four months, we, supported by a certified copyright and
	media law attorney in Germany, went through a long process to
	enforce our license. Even though we had our first successes,
	leading to a recall of the Fat Fritz 2 DVD and the termination of
	the sales of Houdini 6, we were unable to finalize our dispute out
	of court. Due to Chessbase’s repeated license violations, leading
	developers of Stockfish have terminated their GPL license with
	ChessBase permanently. However, ChessBase is ignoring the fact that
	they no longer have the right to distribute Stockfish, modified or
	unmodified, as part of their products.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Commit 8cae8cd89f05
went into the mainline kernel repository on July 19; it puts a limit
on the size of 
buffers allocated in the seq_file mechanism and mentions "int
overflow pitfalls".  For more information, look to this
Qualys advisory describing the vulnerability:


	We discovered a size_t-to-int conversion vulnerability in the Linux
	kernel's filesystem layer: by creating, mounting, and deleting a
	deep directory structure whose total path length exceeds 1GB, an
	unprivileged local attacker can write the 10-byte string
	"//deleted" to an offset of exactly -2GB-10B below the beginning of
	a vmalloc()ated kernel buffer.


It may not sound like much, but they claim to have written exploits for a
number of Ubuntu, Debian, and Fedora distributions.  Updates from
distributors are already flowing, and this patch has been fast-tracked into
today's stable kernel updates as well.]]></summary>
