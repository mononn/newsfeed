deeply into the kernel's implementation of pipes (and more) in an
attempt to maximize the throughput of data.


	The post was inspired by reading a highly optimized FizzBuzz
	program, which pushes output to a pipe at a rate of ~35GiB/s on my
	laptop. Our first goal will be to match that speed, explaining
	every step as we go along. We’ll also add an additional

Stack-based attacks are also the lowest-cost form of attack: Stack layouts are quite predictable because data containing return addresses can be overwritten to gain control over program execution.
Compiler developers have implemented a wide range of countermeasures in response. This article discusses the major stack protection mechanisms in the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) and Clang, typical attack scenarios, and the compiler's attempts to prevent attacks.

It can handle hundreds of thousands, if not millions of messages a second. And, it will store any message it receives for a configurable amount of time, whether the message is consumed or not. That timespan can be weeks, or it can be years. These capabilities alone make Kafka a very powerful technology.
Java, which is published as the Apache Kafka Clients.
The Java client libraries for Kafka streamline a lot of the work that goes into producing messages to and consuming messages from Kafka brokers. But they are not magical.

At Google Play, we are committed to helping developers of all sizes reach their full potential, and go further, faster. To continue supporting indies as they bring some of the most innovative titles to players worldwide, today we’re opening submissions to the 2022 edition of our two annual programs - the Indie Games Accelerator and Festival.  
Through these programs, independent game developers and small studios can boost their game’s visibility, get training, and tap into a network of gaming experts: 
 
If you are a small games studio looking for help to launch or grow a new title, enter the Accelerator to get exclusive training by mentors and industry experts; 
 Or, if you have already created and launched a high quality game that is ready for the spotlight, enter the Festival in Japan, South Korea or Europe for a chance to win promotions and reach new players.  
 
Submissions for both Indie Games programs are open from June 1st to July 1st, 2022.

This article introduces a Jupyter notebook for creating a Pachyderm pipeline that performs edge detection. For convenience, the article uses a Red Hat OpenShift cluster configuration described in an earlier Red Hat Developer article, How to install an open source tool for creating machine learning pipelines, but you can use the notebook on any Kubernetes cluster.
Edge detection with OpenCV
A good way to understand edge detection is to look at Figure 1. Compare the picture my son drew of the cartoon character Sherek, on the left, with the image produced by an edge detection algorithm on the right.

Programming language standards, man pages and the POSIX standard itself have described POSIX signals long ago. However, I often encounter crucial bugs related to POSIX signals even in skilled developers' code. These bugs may be found in both commercial and open source projects. So let's talk about the important stuff once again. (By the way, to newbies in the world of software development: committing to open source projects to fix obvious bugs in POSIX signal handlers is a great way to sharpen your skills in open-source projects and add cases to your portfolio.

Todd says he silently struggled through most of his life with depression and anxiety, so it has become increasingly important to him to be forthright about it. He says ignoring feelings often makes things worse.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The ID-mapped mounts feature was added to
Linux in 5.12, but the general idea behind it goes back a fair bit
further.  There are a number of different situations where the user and
group IDs for files on disk do not match the current human (or process) user of those
files, so ID-mapped mounts provide a way to resolve that problem—without
changing the files on disk.  The developer of the feature, Christian
Brauner, led a discussion at the 
2022 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory-management and BPF Summit (LSFMM) on ID-mapped mounts.]]></summary>

From my experience, I see that even today, many companies struggle to use those standards in production in the most efficient way. As always, with new stuff came benefits, risks, and increased learning effort. Fortunately, with a new book written by top C++ Experts, we have a solid guide on what is safe and what might be problematic in Modern C++.
The book is called “Embracing Modern C++ Safely”.
Let’s see what’s inside.

“I don’t think I have work-life balance,” says Google Workplace GDE Alice Keeler. “I could use some. I’m not very good at self-care, either…my idea of a good time is coding.” 
Alice may be humble, but she juggles numerous responsibilities successfully. In addition to her freelance programming work and the books she has published, she has five children, all of whom have various mental health challenges. An educator known for publishing add-ons, schedulers, and Google Classroom tips, Alice teaches math to high school seniors. She says they also struggle with mental health, often due to poverty and family issues.

about why read-copy-update coverage is not universal in the kernel, the
hazards that can result from that, and what is being done to improve the
situation.


	Unfortunately, an eternally watchful RCU is impractical in the
	Linux kernel due to energy-efficiency considerations. The problem
	is that if RCU watches an idle CPU, RCU needs that CPU to execute
	instructions. And making an idle CPU unnecessarily execute
	instructions (for a rather broad definition of the word
	“unnecessary”) will terminally annoy a great many people in the
	battery-powered embedded world. And for good reason: Making RCU
	avoid watching idle CPUs can provide 30-40% increases in battery

	dropped, or become non-experimental features (and so are included
	in the version bundle).

	The downside with this is that people often can't remember which
	version of Perl introduced which feature(s).

	At some point in the future, the PSC may decide that the set of
	features, taken together, represent a big enough step forward to
	justify a new baseline for Perl. If that happens, then the version
	will be bumped to 7.0.]]></summary>

Software Security Mobilization Plan" that aims to address a number of
perceived security problems with the expenditure of nearly
$140 million over two years.


	While there are considerable ongoing efforts to secure the OSS
	supply chain, to achieve acceptable levels of resilience and risk,
	a more comprehensive series of investments to shift security from a
	largely reactive exercise to a proactive approach is required. Our
	objective is to evolve the systems and processes used to ensure a
	higher degree of security assurance and trust in the OSS supply
	chain.

	This paper suggests a comprehensive portfolio of 10 initiatives
	which can start immediately to address three fundamental goals for
	hardening the software supply chain. Vulnerabilities and weaknesses
	in widely deployed software present systemic threats to the

        <link href="https://www.alexedwards.net/blog/introducing-flow"/>
        <updated>2022-05-25T08:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year I wrote a new HTTP router for Go called Flow. I've been using it in production on this site and in a couple of other projects since, and I'm pretty happy with how it's working out so decided to share it a bit more widely.
My aim with Flow was to bring together my favourite features from other popular routers that I frequently used. It has:
A very small and readable codebase (approx. 160 LOC) with pattern-matching logic similar to matryer/way.
Middleware management like chi — including the ability to create route 'groups' which use different middleware.
Optional regexp support for tighter pattern matching, similar to chi and gorilla/mux.
Automatic handling of OPTIONS requests, like julienschmidt/httprouter.
Automatic handling of HEAD requests, like bmizerany/pat.
An Allow header is automatically set on all OPTIONS and 405 Method Not Allowed responses, like julienschmidt/httprouter.
Ability to map multiple HTTP methods to the same handler in one declaration, like gorilla/mux.
Additionally:
It has a very small API (see the Go docs) so there's not much to learn. 
It's designed to work nicely with http.Handler, http.HandlerFunc, and the standard Go middleware pattern.
The handlers for 404 Not Found and 405 Method Not Allowed responses are customizable.
Conflicting routes are permitted (e.g. /posts/:id and posts/new), with routes matched in the order that they are declared.
It has zero dependencies.
Below is a quick example of the syntax, and if you like the look of it you can check out the full README on GitHub.

  

A note on performance
I haven't done any benchmarking against other routers, so I can't speak about the relative performance of Flow. What I can say it has been plenty fast enough for all of my use-cases so far and not a hot spot when profiling my applications under load.]]></summary>

The Cryostat web client download workflow
Previously, the web client download flow for resources such as recordings, reports, and templates consisted of the application firing an HTTP GET request with the appropriate authorization header(s) to the back-end, downloading the returned file into browser memory, creating a local object URL for the blob, and then assigning the URL to an anchor element prompting user response. The file size determined the download speed and when the "Save File" prompt would appear. Once this process was completed, the use…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cryostat is a tool for managing JDK Flight Recorder data on Kubernetes. Version 2.1 of Cryostat introduces the option of using a sidecar reports container to generate automated analysis reports for JDK flight recordings. Previously, the main Cryostat container handled the report generation. Report generation is a resource-intensive operation, and as a result, users may find themselves overprovisioning the Cryostat container to meet peak resource demands. Those resources may in turn end up unused if you're not generating reports.
With this new option to delegate report generation to a sidecar container, users will find it easier to provision resources more efficiently. When report generation is not a concern, the main Cryostat container, including its web server and various lightweight oper…]]></summary>

The first article covered distributions for local development and self-managed Kafka. This article talks about Kafka as a Service and "serverless-like" Kafka. We'll conclude with guidance on when you should use each type of distribution.
Kafka as a Service
The popularity of Kafka has made it an attractive service for third-party cloud vendors. Each vendor is different, but some of the common criteria for production Kafka clusters include deployment on multiple availability zones, on-demand scaling, compliance and certification assurance, a predictable cost model, and an open platform for third-party tools and services integrations.

A maximum transmission unit (MTU) is the largest packet that can be transmitted as a single entity over a network connection. Each network node defines the MTU for packets it's transmitting through a standard called path MTU discovery (PMTUD). The goal of PMTUD is to choose the most efficient packet size that will succeed in reaching the recipient. In this article, you'll learn how this process works in the Linux kernel's implementation of the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP).
Linux SCTP uses an algorithm called Datagram Packetization Layer Path MTU Discovery (DPLPMTUD, or just PLPMTUD), which is described in RFC 8899. Unlike earlier forms of PMTUD, this method does not rely on reception and validation of Packet Too Big (PTB) ICMP messages. The new im…]]></summary>

How do we empower women in tech and equip them with the skills to help them become true leaders? One way is learning from others' successes and failures. Web GDEs—Debbie O'Brien, Julia Miocene, and Glafira Zhur—discuss the value of one to one mentoring and the impact it has made on their own professional and personal development. 
A 2019 study showed that only 25% of keynote speakers at tech events are women, meanwhile 70% of female speakers mentioned being the only woman on a conference panel. One way of changing that is by running programs and workshops with the aim of empowering women and providing them with the relevant soft skills training, including public speaking, content creation, and leadership. Among such programs are the Women Developer Academy (WDA)…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Andrew 'bunnie' Huang has posted an extensive review of
the Rust language derived from the experience of writing "over
100k lines" of code.


	Rust is a difficult language for authoring code because it makes
	these "cheats" hard – as long as you have the discipline of not
	using "unsafe" constructions to make cheats easy. However, really
	hard does not mean impossible – there were definitely some cheats
	that got swept under the rug during the construction of Xous.

	This is where Rust really exceeded expectations for me. The
	language's structure and tooling was very good at hunting down
	these cheats and refactoring the code base, thus curing the cancer
	without killing the patient, so to speak. This is the point at
	which Rust’s very strict typing and borrow checker converts from a
	productivity liability into a productivity asset.]]></summary>

 Background
 In our ongoing Serverless Migration Station series aimed at helping developers modernize their serverless applications, one of the key objectives for Google App Engine developers is to upgrade to the latest language runtimes, such as from Python 2 to 3 or Java 8 to 17. Another objective is to help developers learn how to move away from App Engine legacy APIs (now called "bundled services") to Cloud standalone equivalent services. Once this has been accomplished, apps are much more portable, making them flexible enough to: 
 
Move to the next-generation App Engine service
Migrate to other serverless platforms, Cloud Functions or Cloud Run (with or without Docker), or 
Shift to other compute platforms

Cryostat 2.1 includes support for GraphQL to control flight recordings on multiple applications, containers, and Kubernetes pods, with powerful filtering capacities. This article discusses the motivation for adding GraphQL support, shares some examples of queries along with expected results, and takes a look at the underlying web requests on the GraphQL endpoint.
Why use GraphQL with Cryostat?
Previous versions of Cryostat exposed flight recordings with a simple HTTP REST API that limited each request to a single conceptual action—starting one recording on one replica instance, for example.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Software Freedom Conservancy (SFC)
has announced
that it succeeded with its motion in US Federal Court to send the case back
to California, where it was originally filed. The suit was filed
in October 2021 by SFC, as an owner of Vizio televisions, to get
the company to comply with the GPL on some of the code in the TVs. Back in November, Vizio had
asked to move the
case to Federal Court, because the GPL is only a copyright license
(which is a dispute handled at the Federal level) and not a contract (that
could be adjudicated in state court).  Friday's ruling disagreed with that premise: 


The May 13 ruling by the Honorable Josephine L. Staton stated that the
claim from Software Freedom Conservancy succeeded in the "extra element
test" and was not preempted by copyright claims, and the court finds "that
the enforcement of 'an additional contractual promise separate and distinct
from any rights provided by the copyright laws' amounts to an 'extra
element,' and therefore, SFC's claims are not preempted." 

"The ruling is a watershed moment in the history of copyleft
licensing. This ruling shows that the GPL agreements function both as
copyright licenses and as contractual agreements," says Karen M. Sandler,
executive director of Software Freedom Conservancy. Sandler noted that many
in the Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) legal community argue
incorrectly that the GPL and other copyleft licenses only function as
copyright licenses.]]></summary>

Let’s go.



     
    


Key observations for std::ranges algorithms:
Ranges algorithms are defined in the <algorithm> header, while the ranges infrastructure and core types are defined in the <ranges> header.
Usually, there are at least two overloads for range algorithms: with a pair of iterators and an overload with a single range argument.
The version that returns a subrange or an iterator and takes a range returns a borrowed range or a borrowed iterator. This helps detect iterators to temporary ranges.
The range versions take projections which allow more flexibility; for …]]></summary>

lock-free queue that fits in a 32-bit integer. The queue is “generic” in
that a single implementation supports elements of any arbitrary type,
despite an implementation in C. It’s lock-free in that there is guaranteed
system-wide progress. It can store up to 32,767 elements at a time — more
than enough for message queues, which must always be bounded. I
will first present a single-consumer, single-producer queue, then expand
support to multiple consumers at a cost. Like my lightweight barrier,
I’m not presenting this as a packaged solution, but rather as a technique
you can apply when circumstances call.
How can the queue store so many elements when it’s just 32 bits? It only
handles the indexes of a circular buffer. The c…]]></summary>

책 소개 :

다양한 해킹 도구를 사용하는 것도 좋지만, 본인이 원하는 기능을 자유자재로 구현해 낼 수 있다면 얼마나 더 편리할까? 직접 필요한 도구를 개발해 고급 보안 전문가로 발돋움할 수 있는 기회다. 2판은 1판의 내용에서 코드를 파이썬3으로 업그레이드하고 여러 최적화를 적용했다. 또한 디지털 포렌식 도구 제작 등의 새로운 내용도 추가했다. 전체적으로 멋진 공격 기법의 구현 방법을 전수하고 있기 때문에 흥미로운 부분이 많으며, 도구 개발에 필요한 프로그래밍 기술을 총체적으로 다룬다.

미국 아마존 서점의 컴퓨터 해킹 및 네트워크 보안 분야에서 독보적인 순위를 자랑하던 책의 2판이 출간됐다. 이 책은 파이썬 프로그래밍 언어를 사용해 모의 침투 업무를 수행 할 수 있도록 이끌어 주는 길잡이 역할을 한다. 단순히 해킹 도구의 사용법만을 다루는 다른 서적과는 다르게 자신이 직접 필요한 도구를 만드는 방법을 안내한다는 점에서 차별화된다. 또한 파이썬의 특성상 이미 잘 설계돼 있는 다양한 모듈들이 많기에 이를 구체적으로 어떻게 활용할 수 있는지를 배운다면 큰 효과를 거둘 수 있다. 이론뿐만 아니라 실전 상황을 가정한 실습도 제시하고 있어 이를 해결하다 보면 고급 보안 전문가로 성장 할 수 있다. 

워낙 저명한 도서의 2판 번역을 맡게 돼 막중한 책임감을 갖고 책의 모든 부분을 차근차근 살펴보며 진행했다. 1판과 비교해 달라진 코드 부분이 생각보다 많았기에 예상 보다 시간이 오래 소요됐다. 모든 예제를 직접 검수하고 테스트해 완성도를 높였다. 특히 오류의 가능성이 있는 코드에 대해서는 저자인 팀 아널드와 소통하며 원서의 내용을 바로잡았으며, 번역서에도 반영했다. 이 책을 통해 한국의 독자가 파이썬 해킹을 학습하는 데 도움이 된다면 나에게도 큰 기쁨이 될 것이다. 
1판을 번역하셨던 민병호 님과 2판 출간 진행을 도와주신 에이콘출판 및 편집자분들 께 이 자리를 빌려 감사의 말씀을 드린다. 그리고 이 책의 번역 과정에서 베타 테스트 및 리뷰를 맡아주신 모의 침투 연구회의 오동진 님, 윤찬민 님, 공재웅 님께도 고마움을 전한다. 이 책 전체를 번역하고 편집까지 거쳐 출간하는 데는 짧지 않은 시간이 소요됐다. 그러나 지치지 않고 꾸준히 힘을 내어 완수할 수 있었던 비결은 언제나 곁에서 응원해 주는 아내의 도움 덕분이다. 딸 주은이가 두 번째 돌을 맞는 시점에서 이 번역서가 드디어 출간된다. 앞으로도 아내와 딸에게 자랑스러운 남편이자 아빠가 되고 싶다.]]></summary>

이 책은 국내 딥러닝 서적 중 가장 친절한 설명이 포함되어 있는 입문서라고 생각된다. 
한국 저자이신 조태호님은 현재 인디애나 의과대학에서 AI, 딥러닝으로 치매를 연구하고 계신다. 틈틈이 아래의 유튜브를 통해 딥러닝 관련 강좌를 진행하시기도한다.
조박사의 편안한 딥러닝 :  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_LvgzB44dGRvOcQqMzdT4g/featured
이 책은 개정3판으로, 2017년에 처음 1판이 출시되었고 2020, 2022에 계속해서 개정이되고 있다. 특히 이번 3판에서는 부록으로 머신러닝에 대한 설명이 추가되면서 책의 분량이 상당히 두꺼워졌다. 지금까지 IT 분야 베스트셀러 목록을 유지중이다. 
1판에서는 딥러닝에 대한 입문서에 초점을 맞추었다면, 1판 이후에도 계속해서 새로운 기술들이 나타나기 시작했고, 그래서 2년이 지났을 무렵 가장 많이 쓰이는 알고리즘 4가지를 추가해 개정 2판을, 그 후 2년이 더 지난 지금, 새로운 챕터 3개와 머신 러닝 알고리즘 10개, 데이터 관리 코드 92개 등을 추가하여 개정 3판의 형태를 갖춘 것이다. 
책은 딥러닝 준비 운동, 기본 동작 원리, 딥러닝의 시작, 딥러닝의 기본기, 딥러닝의 활용, 심화 학습 순서로 진행되며 머신러닝을 다룬 별책 부록도 제공된다.
책의 첫 부분인 <준비 운동> 부분에서는 딥러닝이란 무엇인지에 대한 개념 설명과 역사적 발전 흐름 그리고 수학적 배경 지식을 다룬다.

that the days of proprietary NVIDIA graphics drivers are coming to a close.


	NVIDIA's open kernel modules is already considered "production

	will be ramped up moving forward with future releases. NVIDIA has

	open-source kernel driver. Pre-Turing GPUs are left to using the
	existing proprietary kernel drivers or the Nouveau DRM driver for
	that matter.


The user-space code remains proprietary, though, which could inhibit the
eventual merging of this code into the mainline kernel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To adapt to cloud-native trends, developers must have multiple perspectives on their distributed systems. In particular, they need to understand how their code will smoothly integrate with infrastructure configurations. As the complexity of a microservices architecture evolves, traffic load and cluster use both also increase, which influences development practices at the team level.
In my Red Had Summit 2022 session Efficient resource management with Red Hat OpenShift, you'll discover some best practices and valuable settings to manage application resources in a Red Hat OpenShift cluster. The OpenShift web console can help you monitor workloads, offering both holistic and individual views of deployments, which can guide future application improvements.
We'll start working locally by looking at a Quarkus application with a certain complexity, deploying it to the Red Hat OpenShift Sandbox, and following its behavior under increasing workloads. Next, we will change the pod's CPU and RAM using application configurations by observing metrics within the OpenShift web console. Moreover, we will discuss Kubernetes/OpenShift resources that can protect critical workloads and use Java-based tests to validate those before their actual deployment.
Finally, we'll cover a few essential aspects of sustainable cluster governance that can help teams have a healthier development process.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kubernetes significantly impacts a developer's daily life—and not just for inner loop development such as writing code, compiling, and testing microservices locally. It also drives developers to consider how outer loop development, such as integration testing, continuous deployment, and security, are affected when the applications are containerized to run on Kubernetes.
Of course, you can find a variety of open source tools to improve the developer experience and help solve those challenges. Ironically, however, adopting a new tool can add another concern for developers, since they tend to try to find a way to make a function or feature work with their own tools or development frameworks—even though it sometimes takes time and effort for them to realize that there’s no such thing in their current toolbox.
What if a developer could skip boring but necessary tasks using out-of-box features in the development framework? For example, wouldn't it be great if you didn't need to create Dockerfiles for application containerization, or if you could debug remote code inside pods, or if your framework could perform automated tests when code changes?
Watch my Red Hat Summit 2022 session, Improving developer experience and process from local to Kubernetes. You’ll learn how enterprise developers can improve their development productivity using remote development, remote debugging, live coding, and continuous testing from the developer's local environment to a remote Kubernetes cluster—all without additional CI/CD tool integration.

unbounded manner, as we looked at back in
April, came up at the
2022 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory-management and BPF Summit (LSFMM).
Negative dentries reflect failed file-name lookups, which are then cached,
saving an expensive operation if the file name in question is looked up
again.  There is no mechanism to proactively prune back those cache
entries, however, so the cache keeps growing until memory pressure finally
causes the system to forcibly evict some of them, which can make the system
unresponsive for a long time or even cause a soft lockup.]]></summary>

For last month’s digest, see Kafka Monthly Digest: March 2022.
Releases
There are currently two releases in progress, 3.2.0 and 3.1.1.
3.2.0
The release process for 3.2.0 continued this month. Bruno Cadonna published the first release candidate, RC0, on April 15. However, a few issues were quickly identified: KAFKA-12841, PR-12102, and KAFKA-13794. A new release candidate should be available in the next few days. For more details, you can find the release plan on the Kafka wiki.
3.1.1
Tom Bentley published 3.1.1 RC0 on April 8. The community decided to include the fix for KAFKA-13794; RC1 was published on April 29, and the vote is currently ongoing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The perils of using the Unsafe class in Java applications are well documented. Although Unsafe has historically offered access to low-level programming features, it exposes internal details of the implementation and its use is therefore highly discouraged. If you submit code that uses the Unsafe API to the GraalVM Native Image compiler, you can encounter even more problems that don't exist on dynamic JVMs such as HotSpot.
This article looks at the issues that GraalVM Native Image can potentially introduce with Unsafe, and offers coding techniques that can help you achieve some of the goals you might want to use Unsafe for. Among other things, we'll look at the VarHandles API, which was introduced in the JDK as an alternative to some of the Unsafe APIs.
