Imagine if these pop-ups were carriers that delivered malicious payloads to your devices or captured confidential information. This is a type of cyber attack called cross-site scripting, or XSS. Cross-site scripting is one of the most common attacks in 2022, and it made the OWASP top 10 web application security risks. Let's take a tour of cross-site scripting and learn how an attacker executes malicious JavaScript code on input parameters, creates pop-ups to deface web applications, and can hijack an active user session.

some memory was faster to access than the rest, and memory-management

    More users or use cases inside the kernel, including example drivers – this is pretty important to get merged into the kernel.
    Splitting the kernel crate and managing dependencies to allow better development.
    Extending the current integration of the kernel documentation, testing and other tools.
    Getting more subsystem maintainers, companies and researchers involved.
    Seeing most of the remaining Rust features stabilized.
    Possibly being able to start compiling the Rust code in the kernel with GCC.

debugger skills. I’d shamefully acquired a bad habit: avoiding a debugger
until exhausting dumber, insufficient methods. My first choice should be
a debugger, but I had allowed a bit of friction to dissuade me. With some
thoughtful practice and deliberate effort clearing the path, my bad habit
is finally broken — at least when a good debugger is available. It feels
like I’ve leveled up and, like touch typing, this was a skill I’d
neglected far too long. One friction point was the less-than-optimal
assert feature in basically every programming language implementation.
It ought to work better with debuggers.
An assertion verifies a program invariant, and so if one fails then
there’s undoubtedly a defect in the program. In ot…]]></summary>

A Path to Programming

“I was hooked from the start,” says Jennifer Bailey about programming. Always interested in the way systems work, Jennifer, now an educator in Colorado, found her path to programming in an unconventional way. She first earned a General Educational Development degree, otherwise known as a “GED” in the United States, from Aims Community College, when she was only 15 years old.  
Ever a quick learner with the ambition to excel, she then secured an associate’s degree, bachelor’s, and master’s degree in Applied Science. With degrees in hand, she taught herself C Sharp while working at a local firm as a software developer building desktop applications.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Drew DeVault takes
issue with GitHub's "Copilot" offering and the licensing issues that it raises:


	GitHub’s Copilot is trained on software governed by these terms,
	and it fails to uphold them, and enables customers to accidentally
	fail to uphold these terms themselves. Some argue about the risks
	of a “copyleft surprise”, wherein someone incorporates a GPL
	licensed work into their product and is surprised to find that they
	are obligated to release their product under the terms of the GPL
	as well. Copilot institutionalizes this risk and any user who
	wishes to use it to develop non-free software would be well-advised
	not to do so, else they may find themselves legally liable to
	uphold these terms, perhaps ultimately being required to release
	their works under the terms of a license which is undesirable for
	their goals.


Chances are that many people will disagree with DeVault's reasoning, but
this is an issue that merits some discussion still.]]></summary>

Bring your service to your customer's platforms
A multi-cloud strategy is critical if you want to enable your SaaS application to run in the same physical location that your end customers use. Running on the same network is essential when a SaaS processes a large amount of end customer data or integrates closely with end customer systems. This keeps latency low and avoids expensive charges for inter-region or inter-cloud bandwidth. Since it is unlikely that a S…]]></summary>

 At Google, we often study our own software development work as a means to better understand and make improvements to our engineering practices. In a study that we recently published in Communications of the ACM, we describe how code review pushback varies depending on an author’s demographics. Such pushback, defined as “the perception of unnecessary interpersonal conflict in code review while a reviewer is blocking a change request”, turns out to affect some developers more than others. 
The study looked at pushback during the code review process and, in short, we found that: 
 
Women faced 21% higher odds of pushback than men

Over 2.5 billion people come to Google Play every month to find apps and games created by millions of businesses from all over the world.  
#WeArePlay celebrates you: the global community of people behind these businesses. 
Each one of you creating an app or game has a different story to tell. Some of you have been coders since childhood, others are newbies who got into tech later in life. Some of you are based in busy cities, others in smaller towns. No matter who you are or how different your story is, you all have one thing in common - you have the passion to turn an idea into a business impacting people all over the world.  
Now, and over the coming months, #WeArePlay celebrates you by sharing your stories.





We are kicking off the series with the story of Yvonne and Alyssa, the London-based mother and daughter duo who created Frobelles - a dress up game increasing representation of African and Caribbean hair styles.





You can now also discover the stories of friends Ronaldo, Carlos and Thadeu from Hand Talk Translator (Brazil - my home country!), art lover Zuzanna from DailyArt (Poland) and travel-loving couple Ina & Jonas from TravelSpend (Germany).






To all apps and games businesses - thank you for being a part of the Google Play community. Your dedication and ambition is helping millions of people learn, connect, relax, exercise, find jobs, give back, laugh, have fun, escape to fantasy lands, and so much more.

Even in math, there is such a thing as non-measurable sets and Banach-Tarski paradox, which shows that a three-dimensional ball of radius 1 can be dissected into 5 parts, which can be magically reassembled to form two balls of radius 1. Now imagine what kind of mess we've got in software engineering.
This may sound somewhat philosophical, so let's get down to earth and talk about BPF programs. BPF, which originally stood for Berkeley Packet Filter, is a general-purpose execution engine that can be used for a variety of purposes, including networking, observability, and security.

cornerstones, and this was one of those
references.  The other major
reference being to Ps 118:22.
Unlike Ps 118:22,
this Isaiah verse
had a context that quite captured my attention.  For example, if you back up
by just one verse, you read:

Meta blog post by Johannes Weiner and Dan Schatzberg describes a set of
memory-management changes used there that they call "transparent memory
offloading".


	Transparent Memory Offloading (TMO) is Meta’s solution for
	heterogeneous data center environments. It introduces a new Linux
	kernel mechanism that measures the lost work due to resource
	shortage across CPU, memory, and I/O in real time. Guided by this
	information and without any prior application knowledge, TMO
	automatically adjusts the amount of memory to offload to a
	heterogeneous device, such as compressed memory or an SSD.


The article doesn't say where to find the relevant code, not all of which

System) protocol over the years and found that it was a story worth
telling.  It would be easy for such a story to become swamped by the
details, as there are many of those, but one idea does stand out from
the rest.  The earliest version of NFS has been described as a
"stateless" protocol, a term I still hear used occasionally.  Much of
the story of NFS follows the growth in the acknowledgment of, and
support for, state.  This article looks at the evolution of NFS (and its
handling of state) during the
early part of its life; a second installment will bring the story up to the
present.]]></summary>

Innumerable tools exist—including intrusion detection systems, code scanners, and more—to improve security in an increasingly at-risk software development environment. Unfortunately, few of these are built with the unique risks and needs of a Kubernetes environment in mind. But there are options available.

As for my other books, I used the Leanpub platform for the PDF/Epub generation. Here’s the book’s website:

Data Member Initialization in Modern C++ @Leanpub 



Why I wrote the book? 
  




     
    


Initialization in C++ is a hot topic. With each C++ Standard, we’ll get some updates to the syntax, rules, and new capabilities. With this book, I wanted to clarify the confusion and make it simpler to reason about Modern C++ code.
Have I succeeded?
It’s C++, and you’ll see many opinions, special cases, and even contradicting examples. Yet, I’m happy with my content, and it should certainly improve your knowledge and expand your views.

long been hampered by Red Hat's risk-averse legal department, which
strictly limits the type of software that Fedora can ship.  Specifically,
anything that might be encumbered by patents is off-limits, with the result
that much of the media that users might find on the net is unplayable.  This
situation has improved over the years as the result of a lot of work within
the Fedora project, but it still puts Fedora at a disadvantage relative to
some other distributions.   A recent
discussion on video support, though, shines a light on how some surprising
legal reasoning may be providing a way out of this problem; that way

Having a single code base that runs a variety of enterprise-level business applications reduces the labor that goes into creating and maintaining the software that supports it all. The promise of "one code base to rule them all" makes developing SaaS platforms a value proposition that's hard to ignore—as long as the development team has the expertise to make their ideas real. You need to know a thing or two about creating SaaS platforms. They are a bit of a different beast than single-purpose web applications.

이 글을 작성하는 2022년 5월은 새로운 대통령으로 정권이 이양된 후, 기존의 여러 정책이나 제도가 재정비되는 시기이다. 새 정부에서 여러 공직자가 새로 선출되었고 청와대 비서관 및 각 부처 장관들이 임명되고 있다.
이 블로그는 기술 블로그이므로, 정치 경제 사회의 다양한 내용을 다루지는 않을 것이다. 다만 기술적인 내용을 다루기에 앞서 큰 맥락을 이해하기 위한 취지로 설명을 달아둔다.
검찰 출신인 전직 검사장 한동훈씨가 법무부장관 후보에 지명되었다. 그는 전정권에서 본인의 비위의혹이 있는 상황이었고 그에 따른 수사가 진행되었었다. 그런데 그는 본인의 휴대폰(아이폰) 비밀번호를 잠그고, 알려주지 않았다. 결국 22개월간 수사는 진척되지 않았고 증거불충분으로 무혐의 처분을 받았다.  이런 상황에서 장관후보에 지명이 된 것이고 야당의 반대가 극심한 상황이다. 2022년 5월 9일 장관 인사 청문회가 실시되었다. 이 과정에서 야당 국회의원이 다음과 같은 취지로 질의하였다.

"본인이 한 것은 인권 보호 차원에서 유지가 되어야하고, 남이 하면 수사 회피가 된단 말입니까? 앞으로 한동훈 법무부 장관 시대에, 적어도 검찰에서 수사를 받게 되는 피의자는 휴대폰 비밀번호에 대해서는 고지하지 않는 방식으로 기본권을 보호 받는것이 당연하다는 말인가요?"
"당연한 권리입니다."
"그렇다면 '진술거부권'을 국민 여러분께 다시한번 알려드립니다. 한동훈의 시대에는 아이폰 비밀번호를 굉장히 어렵게 설정하신 후 안알려주시면 됩니다."
"꼭 제 시대에만 문제되는 건 아니고요, 당연한 권리입니다."

이후 한동훈 후보자는 실제로 법…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The mainline kernel has just received a set of patches addressing a new set
of (seemingly) Intel-specific hardware vulnerabilities.


	Processor MMIO Stale Data Vulnerabilities are a class of
	memory-mapped I/O (MMIO) vulnerabilities that can expose data. The
	sequences of operations for exposing data range from simple to very
	complex. Because most of the vulnerabilities require the attacker
	to have access to MMIO, many environments are not affected. System
	environments using virtualization where MMIO access is provided to
	untrusted guests may need mitigation. These vulnerabilities are not
	transient execution attacks. However, these vulnerabilities may
	propagate stale data into core fill buffers where the data can
	subsequently be inferred by an unmitigated transient execution
	attack. Mitigation for these vulnerabilities includes a combination
	of microcode update and software changes, depending on the platform
	and usage model.


Three separate CVE numbers have been issued for variants of this
vulnerability; more information can be found in this documentation
patch.  Stable updates containing these fixes are in the review process
and should be released shortly.]]></summary>

This article draws on the report as well as a Red Hat white paper, How to automate DevSecOps in Red Hat OpenShift, to show the rate of DevSecOps adoption and the factors that we believe make it work well.
The popularity of DevSecOps

But recently, in the late stages of working on the curl utility for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9, I encountered a bug report that looked rather strange. In this article, I will discuss how this report led me to implement a localization bug fix during the late stages of RHEL 9 development.
Why the curl utility with the Turkish locale failed
The curl utility failed in a system configured with the Turkish locale (tr_TR.utf8). The utility crashed in RHEL 9. It did not crash in Fedora 36; however, it failed to establish HTTPS connections.
It was easy to determine that the crash occurred when fetching one of the cipher algorithms—camellia-128. This was strange because the cipher was in…]]></summary>

Introduction and background
The previous Module 12 episode of the Serverless Migration Station video series demonstrated how to add App Engine Memcache usage to an existing app that has transitioned from the webapp2 framework to Flask. Today's Module 13 episode continues its modernization by demonstrating how to migrate that app from Memcache to Cloud Memorystore. Moving from legacy APIs to standalone Cloud services makes apps more portable and provides an easier transition from Python 2 to 3. It also makes it possible to shift to other Cloud compute platforms should that be desired or advantageous. Developers benefit from upgrading to modern language releases and gain added flexibility in application-hosting options.

A recent Red Hat survey with more than 300 respondents, covered in our 2022 State of Kubernetes security report, identified the most pressing security needs and offered suggestions for putting your organization on track to protect security in Kubernetes environments.
Our findings show that what happens in the build and deploy stages has a significant impact on security, as revealed by the prevalence of misconfigurations and vulnerabilities across organizations. Security, therefore, must shift left, embedded imperceptibly into DevOps workflows instead of being "bolted on" when the application is about to be dep…]]></summary>

As we recently announced at I/O, we’re investing in new ways to make Google Assistant your go-to conversational helper for everyday tasks. And we couldn’t do that without a rich community of developers. While Conversational Actions were an excellent way to experiment with voice, the ecosystem has evolved significantly over the last 5 years and we’ve heard some important feedback: users want to engage with their favorite apps using voice, and developers want to build upon their existing investments in Android.  
In response to that feedback, we’ve decided to focus our efforts on making App Actions with Android the best way for developers to create deeper, more meaningful voice-forward experiences. As a result, we will turn down…]]></summary>

Let’s go.



     
    


Key observations for std::ranges algorithms:
Ranges algorithms are defined in the <algorithm> header, while the ranges infrastructure and core types are defined in the <ranges> header.
Usually, there are at least two overloads for range algorithms: with a pair of iterators and an overload with a single range argument.
The version that returns a subrange or an iterator and takes a range returns a borrowed range or a borrowed iterator. This helps detect iterators to temporary ranges.
The range versions take projections which allow more flexibility; fo…]]></summary>

libraries; they would rather ship a single version of each library to be
shared by all packages that need it.  Many upstream projects, instead, are

been covered here numerous times in the past (examples:
1,
2
3,
4,
5, ...).  The recent Fedora discussion on
bundling libraries with its Java implementation would look like just
another in a long series, but it also shines a light on the unique

We’re pleased to announce the General Availability (GA) of App Actions using shortcuts.xml, part of the Android shortcuts framework. By using the Shortcuts API, it’s never been easier to add a layer of voice interaction to your apps, by simply using the Android tooling, platform, and features you already know. This release means your shortcuts.xml implementations are now fully supported through our support channels.  
App Actions let users launch and control Android apps with their voice, using Google Assistant. At Google I/O 2021, we released a beta of App Actions that enabled developers to implement App Actions using the Android shortcuts framework, lowering the development cost of voice enabling apps by leveraging a …]]></summary>

needs.  Should that effort fail, though, the tool of last resort is the
dreaded out-of-memory (OOM) killer, which is tasked with killing processes
on the system to free their memory and alleviate the problem.  The results
of invoking the OOM killer are never going to be good, but they can be
distinctly worse if the wrong processes are chosen for an untimely end.  As
one might expect, the effort to properly choose the right processes is an
ongoing effort.  Most recently, Christian
König has proposed a
new mechanism to address a blind spot in the OOM killer's
deliberations.]]></summary>

Stack-based attacks are also the lowest-cost form of attack: Stack layouts are quite predictable because data containing return addresses can be overwritten to gain control over program execution.
Compiler developers have implemented a wide range of countermeasures in response. This article discusses the major stack protection mechanisms in the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) and Clang, typical attack scenarios, and the compiler's attempts to prevent attacks.

It can handle hundreds of thousands, if not millions of messages a second. And, it will store any message it receives for a configurable amount of time, whether the message is consumed or not. That timespan can be weeks, or it can be years. These capabilities alone make Kafka a very powerful technology.

The Java client libraries for Kafka streamline a lot of the work that goes into producing messages to and consuming messages from Kafka brokers. But they are not magical.

At Google Play, we are committed to helping developers of all sizes reach their full potential, and go further, faster. To continue supporting indies as they bring some of the most innovative titles to players worldwide, today we’re opening submissions to the 2022 edition of our two annual programs - the Indie Games Accelerator and Festival.  
Through these programs, independent game developers and small studios can boost their game’s visibility, get training, and tap into a network of gaming experts: 
 
If you are a small games studio looking for help to launch or grow a new title, enter the Accelerator to get exclusive training by mentors and industry experts; 
 Or, if you have already created and launched a high quality game that is ready for the spotlight, enter the Festival in Japan, South Korea or Europe for a chance to win promotions and reach new players.  
 
Submissions for both Indie Games programs are open from June 1st to July 1st, 2022.

Programming language standards, man pages and the POSIX standard itself have described POSIX signals long ago. However, I often encounter crucial bugs related to POSIX signals even in skilled developers' code. These bugs may be found in both commercial and open source projects. So let's talk about the important stuff once again. (By the way, to newbies in the world of software development: committing to open source projects to fix obvious bugs in POSIX signal handlers is a great way to sharpen your skills in open-source projects and add cases to your portfolio.

Todd says he silently struggled through most of his life with depression and anxiety, so it has become increasingly important to him to be forthright about it. He says ignoring feelings often makes things worse.

Linux in 5.12, but the general idea behind it goes back a fair bit

files, so ID-mapped mounts provide a way to resolve that problem—without
changing the files on disk.  The developer of the feature, Christian
Brauner, led a discussion at the
