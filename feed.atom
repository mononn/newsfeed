may leave new contributors wishing they had a decoder ring. Greg
Sabino Mullane has written up a valuable explainer
for those new to the PostgreSQL hackers (pgsql-hackers)
mailing list that may also be useful for decoding other lists as well:
The mailing lists are full of acronyms and jargon that might not be
familiar to younger people who did not grow up on email (although text
messages have inherited many of the abbreviations). If you are a
non-native English speaker, or under the age of 30, or not steeped in
the world of tech, I offer some solutions below.
To do this, I downloaded the last year's worth of hackers email,
wrote a program to strip out all the non-human stuff (headers, code
blocks, attachments, etc.), and then did some data analysis on the
results.]]></summary>

life: do not run your own email system.  While there numerous advantages to
keeping some control over your communications, there is also a long list of

It is a branch of philosophy dealing with what is morally right or wrong, which is then applied to various areas of knowledge, such as engineering. Ethics supports pillars such as integrity, responsibility, objectivity, fairness, confidentiality, honesty, and veracity.
As intelligent systems exert increasing influence over critical decisions across multiple domains, the need for transparency and fairness is paramount.

What is GPU programming

Your first GPU algorithm: Scan/prefix sum

Your second GPU algorithm: Quicksort

With those topics covered, we can now move on to the subject of this article: how to choose a GPU framework/library.
How to choose a GPU framework
Generally, when you’re benchmarking some GPU code, you want to make sure to do the following:

Run the algorithm more than once, and get the median/quartiles, or mean/stdev of each of the running times.
Synchronize your CUDA kernels, to make sure the program has fully finished executing—by default CUDA will launch kernels asynchronously (in the background) so that the host can continue processing things.

The complaints were basically due to the complexity of implementing all the components necessary to deal with standards such as Saga, for example.
It is important to note that it is not the purpose of this article to make a comparison between distributed transaction handling models, especially the Saga pattern. Likewise, this article should not be taken as a criticism of the Saga pattern or the non-recommendation of its adoption.

In OpenShift, we can make use of the built-in Build, BuildConfig, and Build Strategies (Understanding Image Builds, Understanding BuildConfigs) objects to build container images on cluster nodes.
In a multi-arch compute cluster we can target nodes of a specific architecture with these build objects, and collect these architecture-specific container images into manifest lists of built images that can run anywhere in the cluster.

I didn’t refer to the metaphor since, but meanwhile it grew a life of its own. Other people increasingly referred to the strangler fig approach to modernization, and traffic to that post steadily increased: currently it gets about 5000 page views a month, one of the more popular pages on this site. So I decided I needed to update that page, and have rewritten it, focusing on the core activities we need to do to make a success of such a venture.

This is part 3 of a 4-part series. Catch up on the previous articles:

What is GPU programming

Your first GPU algorithm: Scan/prefix sum

The quicksort algorithm
The reason we’re doing quicksort, rather than something like merge sort, is that it’s very easy to parallelize– once you partition the array, each partition can be sorted completely independently. Plus, it is efficient in the average case, especially if you use randomness to select your pivot. 
Recall that the pseudocode for quicksort is as follows:
def quicksort(array, BLOCK_SIZE):
	p = randomly select pivot from array
	let below_arr = global, reused array that stores the number of items in each block les…]]></summary>

Even the platform itself is based on cluster operators that encapsulate a single aspect of the OpenShift platform (e.g., how to deploy and update the DNS, API server, etc.), database or the internal registry. There is also a huge ecosystem of third party providers that are delivering their software via an operator. 
The general idea behind the concept of operators is to automate installation, updates, backups, configuration, and many other operational tasks that are specific to the application the operator is managing. A concept that will also be useful for managing your own applications on the OpenShift platform. But how to start writing your own operato…]]></summary>

"Note that Windows says this update won't apply to systems that

obviously isn't true, and likely depends on your system configuration
and the distribution being run. It appears to have made some linux efi
shim bootloaders incompatible with microcrap efi bootloaders (that's
why shifting from MS efi to 'other OS' in efi setup works). It appears
that Mint has a shim version that MS SBAT doesn't recognize."
The reports indicate that multiple distributions, including Debian,
Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Zorin OS, and Puppy Linux, are all

how it wasn't detected during testing, or provide technical guidance
to those affected. Company representatives didn't respond to an email

compared to the amount of time that most users spend with them. Ideally,
a user spends only a few minutes using the installer, versus years using

first impression, and if it fails to do its job, little else matters.
Installers also have to continually evolve to keep pace with new
hardware, changes in distribution packaging (such as image-based Linux
distributions), and so forth. Along those lines, the SUSE team that maintains the
venerable YaST installer has
decided it's time to start (almost) fresh with a new Linux installer
project, called Agama,

This algorithm is normally used to demonstrate the power of GPU programming, by showcasing one way to exploit its massively parallel capabilities. However, although this example is useful, it misses out on the techniques involved in more advanced GPU programming, because it views parallel programming as simply a tool that exists to parallelize certain workloads, rather than a language or set of computational tools…]]></summary>

What is Tempo Monolithic mode?
In Tempo Monolithic mode all core components such as compactor, distributor, ingester, querier, and query-frontend of Tempo are contained in a single binary, in a single container. This vastly simplifies the deployment, as only a single pod is created, and avoids potential issues arising from distributed deployments such as connectivity issues between pods or nodes, scheduling issues, etc. Additionally, this mode supports storing traces in…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This article will take you through the process of getting started with Podman Desktop, creating a Node.js application (you can use your preferred programming language instead, if you like) and building it into a container using Podman Desktop, and configuring a continuous integration (CI) pipeline to build and push your container images to Quay.io using GitHub Actions workflows. In essence this is an introduction to the inner and outer loops of cloud-native development.
To get started, install Podman Desktop. This step is pretty straightforward, owing to the fact that Podman Desktop has a downloads page that supports typical installation flows for Linux, macOS, and Windows and has setup guides for each platform. Once installed, it will look something like this (Figure 1).

Affected machines entered a boot loop or boot recovery mode, rendering them inoperative; this underscores  the critical need for robust automated recovery mechanisms in IT infrastructure. One answer being iterated upon by the open source community is Greenboot, which is currently available in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) for Edge, Red Hat In-Vehicle Operating System and Fedora IoT.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Imagine you’re developing a tool that needs to scan for file changes across thousands of project files. Retrieving file attributes efficiently becomes critical for such scenarios. In this article, I’ll demonstrate a technique to get file attributes that can achieve a surprising speedup of over 50+ times compared to standard Windows methods.
Let’s dive in and explore how we can achieve this.

From the given clue, we were unable to do this. Although the game is meant to be a word guessing game based on word clues, a teammate suggested that, based on the physical layout of the words that had been selected, most of the possibilities we were considering would result in patterns that were "too weird" and that we should pick the final word based on the location. This worked and we won.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Researchers from Graz University of Technology have
published details of a new attack
on the Linux kernel called SLUBStick. The attack uses timing information to turn an ability to trigger use-after-free or double-free bugs into the ability to overwrite page tables, and thence into the ability to read and write arbitrary areas of memory. The good news is that this attack does require an existing bug to be usable; the bad news is that the kernel regularly sees bugs of this kind.



We assume that an unprivileged user has code execution. 
Additionally, we consider the presence of a heap vulnerability
in the Linux kernel. We assume that the Linux kernel 
incorporates all defense mechanisms available in version 6.4, the
most recent Linux kernel version when we started our work.
These mechanisms include features such as WˆX, KASLR,
SMAP, and kCFI. We do not assume any microarchitectural 
vulnerabilities, e.g., transient execution, fault
injection, or hardware side channels.]]></summary>

Background
The LLVM libc project was designed as an alternative to glibc that aims to be modular, configurable, and sanitizer-friendly. Currently, LLVM libc is being ported to Nvidia and AMD GPUs to give libc functionality (e.g. printf(), malloc(), and math functions) on the GPU. As of March 2024, programs can use GPU libc in offloading languages (CUDA, OpenMP) or through direct compilation and linking with the libc library.
What We Did
During this project, we developed a microbenchmarking framework that is directly compiled for and run on the GPU, using libc function…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Endless OS is a Linux distribution with a focus on improving access to
educational tools by providing a simple-to-manage, full-featured desktop for
educators and students — one that works offline, with minimal maintenance. The
distribution also aims to be suitable for older devices, in order to promote access to
computers by ensuring those systems remain usable.
In pursuit of those goals, it makes some unusual technical
choices. But what makes the distribution really shine is its curated collection
of software and educational resources.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Time traveling is an extremely useful tool for developers that found a bug in their code. Beyond wanting to travel to a future where the bug is fixed, developers will usually try to slow down time with a debugger, so they can examine where things go wrong. But what if even with a debugger, it is still too late and the bug has already happened? Wouldn’t it be nice to be able to go back in time and see it happening in real time?
Let’s talk about time travel debugging. In this post, I’ll go over the following commands:

record
record stop
record save
record full restore
reverse-next (rn)
reverse-step (rs)
set exec-direction
reverse-continue (rc)

As a final note, there are many implementations on many different debuggers, but this post will be focusing on GNU Debugger’s (GDB) record-full impl…]]></summary>

WebDriver BiDi protocol. Puppeteer can be used to drive headless browser instances, and is commonly used for automated end-to-end web site tests.



Whilst the features offered by Puppeteer won't be a surprise,
bringing support to multiple browsers has been a significant
undertaking. The Firefox support is not based on a Firefox-specific
automation protocol, but on WebDriver BiDi, a cross browser protocol
that's undergoing standardization at the W3C, and currently has
implementation in both Gecko and Chromium. This use of a
cross-browser protocol should make it much easier to support many
different browsers going forward.]]></summary>

a form that can be restarted at a future time — on Linux is almost as old as

can be somewhat fragile and difficult to use; it is not surprising that
some people are interested in finding a better alternative.  A current

Show you working examples of code from OpenAI’s Triton, CUDA, OpenCL, torch.compile, Numba, and HIP/HCC.
Help you determine which framework to use, and go over any common pitfalls.

This guide focuses more on the algorithms and architecture, with a heavy emphasis on how to effectively use the computational model.
