        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since its inclusion in the Linux kernel, the WireGuard VPN tunnel has become
increasingly popular.  In general, WireGuard is simpler to configure than
other VPNs, but the approach that it takes to authentication can present
some challenges. Each node in a WireGuard network has a cryptographic key
that serves as the node's identity; 
nodes that do not know each other's keys cannot directly communicate.
Keeping
track of these keys and distributing them to the other nodes
in a mesh network quickly becomes a chore as the network grows.
Fortunately, there are now 
several open-source 
tools that can automate the management of these keys and make using
WireGuard easier for both administrators and end users.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apache Kafka Streams allow you to implement event-driven and event streaming applications in a distributed environment. Red Hat OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka takes those capabilities to the next level by eliminating the complexity and management involved in implementing and maintaining Kafka instances.
If you're using Amazon Web Services (AWS) to host your Red Hat OpenShift cluster or Red Hat OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka, you'll be pleased to know that the AWS Marketplace now offers Red Hat OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka for AWS (Figure 1).

  


          


This Kafka installation is managed by Red Hat, freeing you to focus on developing code instead of maintaining infrastructure. The service also works alongside the Service Binding Operator in OpenShift. Once you install the Operator, connecting your code to a Kafka instance can be as simple as drag and drop (Figure 2).

  


          


The Service Binding Operator also makes it easy to experiment with these technologies by running our Managed Kafka sandbox activity in an existing OpenShift cluster on AWS.
Finally; if you have already created the Sandbox Activity in our sandbox, and want to move it to your AWS cluster, check out the GitOps Primer Operator, which gives you the ability to export all Kubernetes objects within a namespace as a portable zip file that can be easily taken to another cluster.
Happy coding!

I will begin by illustrating the problem with a fictional company called ACME Corporation and its software engineer Wile E. Then I will present trivial examples to reveal the problem and how to avoid it.
The story of a reused Go error variable
A user opened a new issue to ACME Corporation because he noticed that users could enter any string into the phone number on the contact form. Wile E. is in charge of implementing a fix.
Wile E. examines the code:
func StoreAllContacts() {
  for _, c := range contactsToStore {
    err := legacy.StoreContact(&c)
    if err != nil {
      fmt.Printf("Error storing %v: %v\n", c, err)

the existence of yet another new operating system, called KataOS, aimed at
the creation of secure embedded systems.


	As the foundation for this new operating system, we chose seL4 as
	the microkernel because it puts security front and center; it is
	mathematically proven secure, with guaranteed confidentiality,
	integrity, and availability. Through the seL4 CAmkES framework,
	we're also able to provide statically-defined and analyzable system
	components. KataOS provides a verifiably-secure platform that
	protects the user's privacy because it is logically impossible for
	applications to breach the kernel's hardware security protections
	and the system components are verifiably secure. KataOS is also
	implemented almost entirely in Rust, which provides a strong
	starting point for software security, since it eliminates entire
	classes of bugs, such as off-by-one errors and buffer overflows.]]></summary>

change does give kernel developers a chance to play with the language in

was designed from the beginning to avoid existing patents in the field and
be royalty-free for all users.  It was standardized by the IETF in 2012 as
RFC 6716.
Now a company called Vectis ("a premier
full-suite IP licensing and consultancy boutique") is collecting
patents that are claimed to read on Opus as a way of demanding
royalties on its use. 
"The planned Opus program will focus on hardware devices and will not be
directed towards open-source software, applications, services, or
content".  (Thanks to Paul Wise).]]></summary>

The article also introduced the Kryptonite for Kafka project, which integrates with Apache Kafka Connect to achieve automatic encryption and decryption with no changes to application code.
This article, the second and last in this series, contains more advanced examples that cover a common scenario: File-based data integration between different kinds of storage. I'll show Kryptonite for Kafka features that support fine-grained, field-level encryption in this use case.
To keep things simple in the examples, a local file system serves as the source while the sink is set up in MinIO (Figure 1), an open source object storage service compatible with AWS S3.

Rose Niousha wanted to create a community where students could explore their technical interests without being held back by external factors or stereotypes. A passion for inclusion set her on a path to growing her Google Developer Student Clubs chapter and discovering the Women Techmakers (WTM) program.
After majoring in Computer Science at Waseda University, Rose realized many students had difficulty applying what they learned in school to practical environments and internships. Seeing a gap between theory and practice, she aimed to tackle these problems by founding a Google Developer Student Club (GDSC) on her campus. Through her leadership, the club became the largest chapter in Japan, with 177 active members. This…]]></summary>

A typical big enterprise with multiple development teams might build hundreds of APIs that they would want to reuse internally or share with partners that build complementary applications. If the teams cannot discover existing APIs, they might build a new API with the same functionality, which leads to duplication of efforts and underutilization of the existing API. It is also an unscalable practice to contact the API developer each time someone wants to use the API.
There needs to be a better and more hands-off way for internal teams and partners to discover and understand the usage of these APIs without directly contacting the developers who built t…]]></summary>

extensive details on what it takes to implement a safe semaphore type
in the Rust language.


	The problem is that with n > 1, there’s no concept of a
	“privileged” owning thread and all threads that have “obtained” the
	semaphore do so equally. Therefore, a rust semaphore can only ever
	provide read-only (&T) access to an underlying resource,
	limiting the usefulness of such a semaphore almost to the point of
	having no utility. As such, the only safe “owning” semaphore with
	read-write access that can exist in the rust world would be
	Semaphore<()>, or one that actually owns no data and can
	only be used for its side effect of limiting concurrency while the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Go has a nifty synchronization utility called a WaitGroup, on which
one or more goroutines can wait for concurrent task completion. In other
languages, the usual task completion convention is joining threads doing
the work. In Go, goroutines aren’t values and lack handles, so a WaitGroup
replaces joins. Building a WaitGroup using typical, portable primitives is
a messy affair involving constructors and destructors, managing lifetimes.
However, on at least Linux and Windows, we can build a WaitGroup out of a
zero-initialized integer, much like my 32-bit queue and 32-bit
barrier.
In case you’re not familiar with it, a typical WaitGroup use case in Go:

var wg sync.WaitGroup
for _, task := range tasks {
    wg.Add(1)
    go func(t Task) {
        // ... do task ...
        wg.Done()

With RPM, users can install an application from a terminal window by executing nothing more than a single command:

Or:
yum install 



Most users never need to go beyond using the dnf or yum install commands, which we reviewed in an earlier article, Move from apt to dnf package management. These commands hide the complexity of what's going on underneath the covers during the installation process. But when things go wrong with an installation, it's useful to understand how RPM goes about locating and installing applications, at least for debugging purposes.

numerous improvement efforts over the years for a
variety of reasons.  One persistent problem with printk() has been
that its latency is unacceptably high for the realtime Linux kernel; at
this point, printk() represents the last piece needing changes
before the 
RT_PREEMPT patches can be fully merged.  So there have been efforts
to rework printk() for latency and lots of other reasons, but
those have not made it into the mainline; a recent discussion at
the 2022 Linux Plumbers Conference (LPC)

debuggers and fuzzing. I typically have at least one sanitizer
active during development. They’re particularly useful during code review,
where they can identify issues before I’ve even begun examining the code
carefully — sometimes in mere minutes under fuzzing. Accordingly, it’s a
good idea to have your own code in good agreement with sanitizers before
review. For ThreadSanitizer (TSan), that means dealing with false
positives in programs relying on synchronization invisible to TSan.
This article’s motivation is multi-threaded epoll. I mitigate TSan
false positives each time it comes up, enough to have gotten the hang of

	But of course there's a lot of various changes in 6.0 - we've got

	such 6.0 is one of the bigger releases at least in numbers of
	commits in a while.


Headline features in 6.0 include
a number of io_uring improvements including support for buffered writes to
XFS filesystems and zero-copy network
transmission,
an io_uring-based block driver mechanism,
the runtime verification subsystem,
and much more; see

I did this so that I could easily read this and, after reading it, I've found that most accountings of what was said are, in one way or another, fairly misleading. Since the texts aren't all that long, if you're interested in what they said, I would recommended that you just read the texts in their entirety (to the extent they're available — the texts make it clear that some parts of conversations are simply not included) instead of reading what various journalists excerpted, which seems to sometimes be deliberately misleading because selectively quoting allows them to write a story that matches the…]]></summary>

They act as microservices and can abstract the entirety of inference execution, making them agnostic to the training framework and hardware. They also offer easy scalability and efficient resource utilization.




          
Red Hat OpenShift and Kubernetes are optimal places for deploying model servers. However, managing them directly can be a complex task in a large-scale environment. In this article, you'll learn how the OpenVINO Model Server Operator can make it straightforward.
Operator installation
The operator can be easily installed from the OpenShift console. Just navigate to the OperatorHub menu (Figure 2), search for OpenVINO™ Toolkit Operator, then click the Install button.

Color management infrastructure code has landed that allows HDR [high dynamic range] characteristics to be delivered to an HDR-capable monitor by setting-up HDR metadata in a weston.ini configuration file and delivering that to KMS [kernel mode setting]. Once Weston gains the ability to produce HDR content in a future version, it will come naturally supported.

This new version brings in multiple RDP [remote desktop protocol] improvements, like clipboard pasting, various keyboard language support, bumped support for a newer version of FreeRDP library, and many more other improvements and fixes.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Flexible array members (FAM) is an extension of C89 standardized in C99. This article discusses how flexible array members offer convenience and improve performance and how compiler implementations can generate complications.
FAM makes it possible to declare a struct with a dynamic size while keeping a flat memory layout. This is a textbook example:
struct fam {

     int size;

     double data[ ];

};
The data array starts empty and will be loaded later, perhaps many times. Presumably, the programmer uses the size member to hold the current number of elements and updates that variable with each change to the data size.
Flexible array members vs. pointer implementation
Flexible array members allow faster allocation, better locality, and solid code generation. The feature is an alternative…]]></summary>

Range based for loop with an initializer
Iterators
Algorithms
Ranges and views
See examples below:



     
    


Let’s start with the following code; we’d like to print a std::vector in reverse:

	Yeah, maybe it's marginally bigger than the historical average for
	this time of the release cycle, but it definitely isn't some

engineering. The core logic of the Linux kernel is written entirely in
C (with a bit of assembly), as are its drivers and modules. While C is
rightfully celebrated for
its powerful yet simple semantics, it is an older language that lacks
many of the features present in modern languages such as
Rust. The
BPF subsystem, on the other hand,
provides a programming environment that allows engineers to write
programs that can run safely in kernel space. At the 2022 Linux Plumbers 
Conference in Dublin, Ireland, Alexei Starovoitov presented an overview
of how BPF has evolved over the years to provide a new model for kernel

Version 17.0 of the platform includes dynamic routing for both the control and data planes. This lets you deploy a cluster in a pure layer-3 (L3) data center, overcoming the scaling issues of traditional layer-2 (L2) infrastructures such as large failure domains, large broadcast traffic, or long convergence times in the event of failures.
This article will illustrate this new feature by outlining a simple three-rack spine and leaf topology, where the layer-2 boundaries are within each rack on the Red Hat OpenStack Platform. The control plane spans the three racks, and each rack also hosts a compute node. Figure 1 illustrates our topology.

As part of our commitment to helping all developers grow on our platform, at Google Play we have various programs focused on supporting small games studios. A few weeks ago we announced the winners of the Indie Games Festival in Europe, Korea and Japan, and the 2022 class of the Indie Games Accelerator.

Today, we are launching the Indie Games Fund in Latin America. We will be awarding $2 million dollars in non-dilutive cash awards, in addition to hands-on support, to selected small games studios based in LATAM, to help them build and grow their businesses on Google Play.
The program is open to indie game developers who have already launched a game - whether it’s on Google Play or another mobile platform, PC or console. Each selected recipient will get between $150,000 and $200,000 dollars to help them take their game to the next level, and build successful businesses.
Check out all eligibility criteria and apply now. Priority will be given to applications received by 12:00 p.m. BRT, 31 October, 2022. 
For more updates about all our programs, resources and tools for indie game developers, follow us on Twitter @GooglePlayBiz and Google Play business community on LinkedIn.

when using Verilog’s simulation semantics.  Let me therefore share some
problems I’ve come across, together with my proposed solution for them.
The Problems
Today’s problem stems from logic like the following:
always @(trigger_condition)
begin
	if (some_other_condition_determining_relevance)
	begin
		#1;
		state_variable = complex_expression;
		// This then continues for another 50 lines or so

In general, this comes to me in “working” simulation code that’s been handed
down to me to maintain.  The simulations that use this logic often take hours
to run, and so debugging this sort of thing can be very time consuming.
(Costly too–my hourly rate isn’t cheap.)

But few people credit two deeply buried technologies for making the internet possible: hashing and cryptography.
If more people understood the role these technologies play, more money and expertise would go toward uncovering and repairing security flaws. For instance, we probably would have fixed the Heartbleed programming error much earlier and avoided widespread vulnerabilities in encrypted traffic.
This article briefly explains where hashing and cryptography come from, how they accomplish what they do, and their indelible effect on the modern internet.
