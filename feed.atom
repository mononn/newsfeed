CPU time to all tasks in the system that is fair, allows all tasks to
progress, and maximizes the throughput of the system as a whole.  More
recently, it has been called upon to satisfy another constraint: minimizing
the system's energy consumption.   There is currently a
patch set in circulation, posted by Vincent Donnefort with work from
Dietmar Eggemann as well, that changes how this constraint is met.  The
actual change is small, but it illustrates how hard it can be to get the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Software Freedom Conservancy (SFC) has issued a strong call for free software projects to give up GitHub and to move their repositories elsewhere.  There are a number of problems that SFC has identified with the GitHub code-hosting service and, in particular, with its Copilot AI-based code-writing tool that was trained on the community's code stored in the company's repositories.  Moving away from GitHub will not be easy, SFC said, but it is important to do so lest the free-software community repeat the SourceForge mistake.


Specifically, we at Software Freedom Conservancy have been actively communicating with Microsoft and their GitHub subsidiary about our concerns with "Copilot" since they first launched it almost exactly a year ago. Our initial video chat call (in July 2021) with Microsoft and GitHub representatives resulted in several questions which they said they could not answer at that time, but would "answer soon". [...] Last week, after we reminded GitHub of (a) the pending questions that we'd waited a year for them to answer and (b) of their refusal to join public discussion on the topic, they responded a week later, saying they would not join any public nor private discussion on this matter because "a broader conversation [about the ethics of AI-assisted software] seemed unlikely to alter your [SFC's] stance, which is why we [GitHub] have not responded to your [SFC's] detailed questions". In other words, GitHub's final position on Copilot is: if you disagree with GitHub about policy matters related to Copilot, then you don't deserve a reply from Microsoft or GitHub. They only will bother to reply if they think they can immediately change your policy position to theirs. But, Microsoft and GitHub will leave you hanging for a year before they'll tell you that!]]></summary>

2. Use dsc to create an OpenShift Dev Spaces instance in your cluster
10 minutes
Log into your OpenShift cluster with cluster-admin rights.
From your command line, run the command: 
	
dsc server:start
This will create an OpenShift Dev Spaces instance in the OpenShift project "workspaces" (which will be created if it does not exist). When it is finished, the Dev Spaces URL will be returned.
Run Hello World
After logging in to your Dev Spaces instance, select any sample stack and click the "Create and Open" button.

editor has been released.  The biggest change would appear to be the
addition of the "Vim9 Script" language for editor customization:



	The main goal of Vim9 script is to drastically improve
	performance. This is accomplished by compiling commands into
	instructions that can be efficiently executed. An increase in
	execution speed of 10 to 100 times can be expected.
	
	A secondary goal is to avoid Vim-specific constructs and get closer

Cross-site scripting is one of the most common attacks in 2022, and it made the OWASP top 10 web application security risks. Let's take a tour of cross-site scripting and learn how an attacker executes malicious JavaScript code on input parameters, creates pop-ups to deface web applications, and can hijack an active user session.

This article, the first in a two-part series, shows how SystemTap can reveal potential performance problems down to individual lines of code. The second part of the series will describe how a SystemTap performance monitoring script was written.
The SystemTap examples repository
Writing a program from scratch in an unfamiliar language can be daunting. To make it easier for people to use SystemTap, the project provides a collection of examples. Some investigate common system issues. Other examples are there to demonstrate particular SystemTap features.

debugger skills. I’d shamefully acquired a bad habit: avoiding a debugger
until exhausting dumber, insufficient methods. My first choice should be
a debugger, but I had allowed a bit of friction to dissuade me. With some
thoughtful practice and deliberate effort clearing the path, my bad habit
is finally broken — at least when a good debugger is available. It feels
like I’ve leveled up and, like touch typing, this was a skill I’d
neglected far too long. One friction point was the less-than-optimal
assert feature in basically every programming language implementation.
It ought to work better with debuggers.
An assertion verifies a program invariant, and so if one fails then
there’s undoubtedly a defect in the program. In ot…]]></summary>

A Path to Programming

“I was hooked from the start,” says Jennifer Bailey about programming. Always interested in the way systems work, Jennifer, now an educator in Colorado, found her path to programming in an unconventional way. She first earned a General Educational Development degree, otherwise known as a “GED” in the United States, from Aims Community College, when she was only 15 years old.  
Ever a quick learner with the ambition to excel, she then secured an associate’s degree, bachelor’s, and master’s degree in Applied Science. With degrees in hand, she taught herself C Sharp while working at a local firm as a software developer building desktop applications.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Drew DeVault takes
issue with GitHub's "Copilot" offering and the licensing issues that it raises:


	GitHub’s Copilot is trained on software governed by these terms,
	and it fails to uphold them, and enables customers to accidentally
	fail to uphold these terms themselves. Some argue about the risks
	of a “copyleft surprise”, wherein someone incorporates a GPL
	licensed work into their product and is surprised to find that they
	are obligated to release their product under the terms of the GPL
	as well. Copilot institutionalizes this risk and any user who
	wishes to use it to develop non-free software would be well-advised
	not to do so, else they may find themselves legally liable to
	uphold these terms, perhaps ultimately being required to release
	their works under the terms of a license which is undesirable for
	their goals.


Chances are that many people will disagree with DeVault's reasoning, but
this is an issue that merits some discussion still.]]></summary>

A multi-cloud strategy is critical if you want to enable your SaaS application to run in the same physical location that your end customers use. Running on the same network is essential when a SaaS processes a large amount of end customer data or integrates closely with end customer systems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a keynote at PyCon 2022 in Salt
Lake City, Utah, Peter Wang introduced another entrant in the field of
in-browser Python interpreters.  The Python community has long sought a way
to be able to write Python—instead of JavaScript—to run in web browsers, and there
have been various efforts to do so over the years.  Wang announced PyScript as a new framework, built atop
one of those earlier projects, to allow
Python scripting directly within the browser; those programs have access to
much of the existing Python ecosystem as well as being able to interact
with the browser document object model (DOM) directly. 
In addition, he gave some rather eye-opening demonstrations as part of the talk.]]></summary>

 At Google, we often study our own software development work as a means to better understand and make improvements to our engineering practices. In a study that we recently published in Communications of the ACM, we describe how code review pushback varies depending on an author’s demographics. Such pushback, defined as “the perception of unnecessary interpersonal conflict in code review while a reviewer is blocking a change request”, turns out to affect some developers more than others. 
The study looked at pushback during the code review process and, in short, we found that: 
 
Women faced 21% higher odds of pushback than men  
Black+ developers faced 54% higher odds than White+ …]]></summary>

Over 2.5 billion people come to Google Play every month to find apps and games created by millions of businesses from all over the world.  
#WeArePlay celebrates you: the global community of people behind these businesses. 
Each one of you creating an app or game has a different story to tell. Some of you have been coders since childhood, others are newbies who got into tech later in life. Some of you are based in busy cities, others in smaller towns. No matter who you are or how different your story is, you all have one thing in common - you have the passion to turn an idea into a business impacting people all over the world.  
Now, and over the coming months, #WeArePlay celebrates you by sharing your stories.





We are kicking off the series with the story of Yvonne and Alyssa, the London-based mother and daughter duo who created Frobelles - a dress up game increasing representation of African and Caribbean hair styles.





You can now also discover the stories of friends Ronaldo, Carlos and Thadeu from Hand Talk Translator (Brazil - my home country!), art lover Zuzanna from DailyArt (Poland) and travel-loving couple Ina & Jonas from TravelSpend (Germany).






To all apps and games businesses - thank you for being a part of the Google Play community. Your dedication and ambition is helping millions of people learn, connect, relax, exercise, find jobs, give back, laugh, have fun, escape to fantasy lands, and so much more.

Even in math, there is such a thing as non-measurable sets and Banach-Tarski paradox, which shows that a three-dimensional ball of radius 1 can be dissected into 5 parts, which can be magically reassembled to form two balls of radius 1. Now imagine what kind of mess we've got in software engineering.
This may sound somewhat philosophical, so let's get down to earth and talk about BPF programs. BPF, which originally stood for Berkeley Packet Filter, is a general-purpose execution engine that can be used for a variety of purposes, including networking, observability, and security.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This
Meta blog post by Johannes Weiner and Dan Schatzberg describes a set of
memory-management changes used there that they call "transparent memory
offloading".


	Transparent Memory Offloading (TMO) is Meta’s solution for
	heterogeneous data center environments. It introduces a new Linux
	kernel mechanism that measures the lost work due to resource
	shortage across CPU, memory, and I/O in real time. Guided by this
	information and without any prior application knowledge, TMO
	automatically adjusts the amount of memory to offload to a
	heterogeneous device, such as compressed memory or an SSD.


The article doesn't say where to find the relevant code, not all of which
is in the mainline kernel (and some of which runs in user space).]]></summary>

System) protocol over the years and found that it was a story worth
telling.  It would be easy for such a story to become swamped by the
details, as there are many of those, but one idea does stand out from
the rest.  The earliest version of NFS has been described as a
"stateless" protocol, a term I still hear used occasionally.  Much of
the story of NFS follows the growth in the acknowledgment of, and
support for, state.  This article looks at the evolution of NFS (and its
handling of state) during the
early part of its life; a second installment will bring the story up to the

Data Member Initialization in Modern C++ @Leanpub 



Why I wrote the book? 
  




     
    


Initialization in C++ is a hot topic. With each C++ Standard, we’ll get some updates to the syntax, rules, and new capabilities. With this book, I wanted to clarify the confusion and make it simpler to reason about Modern C++ code.
Have I succeeded?
It’s C++, and you’ll see many opinions, special cases, and even contradicting examples. Yet, I’m happy with my content, and it should certainly improve your knowledge and expand your views.

long been hampered by Red Hat's risk-averse legal department, which
strictly limits the type of software that Fedora can ship.  Specifically,
anything that might be encumbered by patents is off-limits, with the result

situation has improved over the years as the result of a lot of work within
the Fedora project, but it still puts Fedora at a disadvantage relative to
some other distributions.   A recent

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offers a compelling opportunity for developers who create software originally intended to run at web scale. Having a single code base that runs a variety of enterprise-level business applications reduces the labor that goes into creating and maintaining the software that supports it all. The promise of "one code base to rule them all" makes developing SaaS platforms a value proposition that's hard to ignore—as long as the development team has the expertise to make their ideas real. You need to know a thing or two about creating SaaS platforms. They are a bit of a different beast than single-purpose web applications.
There are two ways to create a SaaS platform. One is the "greenfield" approach: Build a SaaS platform from scratch. The other way is to transform a…]]></summary>

이 글을 작성하는 2022년 5월은 새로운 대통령으로 정권이 이양된 후, 기존의 여러 정책이나 제도가 재정비되는 시기이다. 새 정부에서 여러 공직자가 새로 선출되었고 청와대 비서관 및 각 부처 장관들이 임명되고 있다.
이 블로그는 기술 블로그이므로, 정치 경제 사회의 다양한 내용을 다루지는 않을 것이다. 다만 기술적인 내용을 다루기에 앞서 큰 맥락을 이해하기 위한 취지로 설명을 달아둔다.
검찰 출신인 전직 검사장 한동훈씨가 법무부장관 후보에 지명되었다. 그는 전정권에서 본인의 비위의혹이 있는 상황이었고 그에 따른 수사가 진행되었었다. 그런데 그는 본인의 휴대폰(아이폰) 비밀번호를 잠그고, 알려주지 않았다. 결국 22개월간 수사는 진척되지 않았고 증거불충분으로 무혐의 처분을 받았다.  이런 상황에서 장관후보에 지명이 된 것이고 야당의 반대가 극심한 상황이다. 2022년 5월 9일 장관 인사 청문회가 실시되었다. 이 과정에서 야당 국회의원이 다음과 같은 취지로 질의하였다.

"본인이 한 것은 인권 보호 차원에서 유지가 되어야하고, 남이 하면 수사 회피가 된단 말입니까? 앞으로 한동훈 법무부 장관 시대에, 적어도 검찰에서 수사를 받게 되는 피의자는 휴대폰 비밀번호에 대해서는 고지하지 않는 방식으로 기본권을 보호 받는것이 당연하다는 말인가요?"
"당연한 권리입니다."
"그렇다면 '진술거부권'을 국민 여러분께 다시한번 알려드립니다. 한동훈의 시대에는 아이폰 비밀번호를 굉장히 어렵게 설정하신 후 안알려주시면 됩니다."
"꼭 제 시대에만 문제되는 건 아니고요, 당연한 권리입니다."

이후 한동훈 후보자는 실제로 법…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The mainline kernel has just received a set of patches addressing a new set
of (seemingly) Intel-specific hardware vulnerabilities.


	Processor MMIO Stale Data Vulnerabilities are a class of
	memory-mapped I/O (MMIO) vulnerabilities that can expose data. The
	sequences of operations for exposing data range from simple to very
	complex. Because most of the vulnerabilities require the attacker
	to have access to MMIO, many environments are not affected. System
	environments using virtualization where MMIO access is provided to
	untrusted guests may need mitigation. These vulnerabilities are not
	transient execution attacks. However, these vulnerabilities may
	propagate stale data into core fill buffers where the data can
	subsequently be inferred by an unmitigated transient execution
	attack. Mitigation for these vulnerabilities includes a combination
	of microcode update and software changes, depending on the platform
	and usage model.


Three separate CVE numbers have been issued for variants of this
vulnerability; more information can be found in this documentation
patch.  Stable updates containing these fixes are in the review process
and should be released shortly.]]></summary>

But recently, in the late stages of working on the curl utility for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9, I encountered a bug report that looked rather strange. In this article, I will discuss how this report led me to implement a localization bug fix during the late stages of RHEL 9 development.
Why the curl utility with the Turkish locale failed
The curl utility failed in a system configured with the Turkish locale (tr_TR.utf8). The utility crashed in RHEL 9. It did not crash in Fedora 36; however, it failed to establish HTTPS connections.
It was easy to determine that the crash occurred when fetching one of the cipher algorithms—camellia-128. This was strange because the cipher was in…]]></summary>

Introduction and background
The previous Module 12 episode of the Serverless Migration Station video series demonstrated how to add App Engine Memcache usage to an existing app that has transitioned from the webapp2 framework to Flask. Today's Module 13 episode continues its modernization by demonstrating how to migrate that app from Memcache to Cloud Memorystore. Moving from legacy APIs to standalone Cloud services makes apps more portable and provides an easier transition from Python 2 to 3. It also makes it possible to shift to other Cloud compute platforms should that be desired or advantageous. Developers benefit from upgrading to modern language releases and gain added flexibility in application-hosting options.

      backlog: a list of user stories. These stories capture who needs the work,

A recent Red Hat survey with more than 300 respondents, covered in our 2022 State of Kubernetes security report, identified the most pressing security needs and offered suggestions for putting your organization on track to protect security in Kubernetes environments.
Our findings show that what happens in the build and deploy stages has a significant impact on security, as revealed by the prevalence of misconfigurations and vulnerabilities across organizations. Security, therefore, must shift left, embedded imperceptibly into DevOps workflows instead of being "bolted on" when the application is about to be dep…]]></summary>

QuartzNet is a variant of a Jasper network that performs speech-to-text translation.

As we recently announced at I/O, we’re investing in new ways to make Google Assistant your go-to conversational helper for everyday tasks. And we couldn’t do that without a rich community of developers. While Conversational Actions were an excellent way to experiment with voice, the ecosystem has evolved significantly over the last 5 years and we’ve heard some important feedback: users want to engage with their favorite apps using voice, and developers want to build upon their existing investments in Android.  
In response to that feedback, we’ve decided to focus our efforts on making App Actions with Android the best way for developers to create deeper, more meaningful voice-forward experiences. As a result, we will turn down…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a recent Red Hat survey of more than 300 production-level Kubernetes users, 93% of respondents admitted to experiencing at least one security incident in their Kubernetes environments during the previous year—and 31% of respondents say they experienced revenue or customer loss during that year as a consequence.
Our industry can do better. This article summarizes findings from the survey, reported in our 2022 State of Kubernetes security report, and highlights the weak points of Kubernetes security today along with a path forward involving DevSecOps.
Note: Most of the material in this article comes from the Red Hat report, 2022 State of Kubernetes security.

This exercise has given me insight into meaningful topics only briefly touched upon at my university, such as kernel space, user space, and virtual memory. But these concepts are fundamental to the proper and safe execution of programs on any modern operating system. The trade off is some address translation when viewing memory from kernel space versus user space. In this article, you'll see how that translation can be handled.

Key observations for std::ranges algorithms:
Ranges algorithms are defined in the <algorithm> header, while the ranges infrastructure and core types are defined in the <ranges> header.
Usually, there are at least two overloads for range algorithms: with a pair of iterators and an overload with a single range argument.
The version that returns a subrange or an iterator and takes a range returns a borrowed range or a borrowed iterator. This helps detect iterators to temporary ranges.
The range versions take projections which allow more flexibility; fo…]]></summary>

bundling libraries with its Java implementation would look like just
another in a long series, but it also shines a light on the unique

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many programming errors turn up when one function calls another. They can be caused, for instance, because the caller passes bad arguments or because a function is called when it shouldn't be. This article shows the tools offered to meet these challenges by the GNU Debugger (GDB), the standard open source debugger for C and C++ programs.
The commands in this article manipulate stack frames, which represent all the information stored on the stack when one function calls another. GDB allows you to see a lot of information related to each function call, such as local variables, who called what, and much more.
We will talk specifically about the following GDB commands:

We’re pleased to announce the General Availability (GA) of App Actions using shortcuts.xml, part of the Android shortcuts framework. By using the Shortcuts API, it’s never been easier to add a layer of voice interaction to your apps, by simply using the Android tooling, platform, and features you already know. This release means your shortcuts.xml implementations are now fully supported through our support channels.  
App Actions let users launch and control Android apps with their voice, using Google Assistant. At Google I/O 2021, we released a beta of App Actions that enabled developers to implement App Actions using the Android shortcuts framework, lowering the development cost of voice enabling apps by leveraging a …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The kernel tries hard to keep memory available for its present and future
needs.  Should that effort fail, though, the tool of last resort is the
dreaded out-of-memory (OOM) killer, which is tasked with killing processes
on the system to free their memory and alleviate the problem.  The results
of invoking the OOM killer are never going to be good, but they can be
distinctly worse if the wrong processes are chosen for an untimely end.  As
one might expect, the effort to properly choose the right processes is an
ongoing effort.  Most recently, Christian
König has proposed a
new mechanism to address a blind spot in the OOM killer's
deliberations.]]></summary>

deeply into the kernel's implementation of pipes (and more) in an
attempt to maximize the throughput of data.


	The post was inspired by reading a highly optimized FizzBuzz
	program, which pushes output to a pipe at a rate of ~35GiB/s on my
	laptop. Our first goal will be to match that speed, explaining
	every step as we go along. We’ll also add an additional
	performance-improving measure, which is not needed in FizzBuzz
