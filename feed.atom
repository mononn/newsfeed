They act as microservices and can abstract the entirety of inference execution, making them agnostic to the training framework and hardware. They also offer easy scalability and efficient resource utilization.




          
Red Hat OpenShift and Kubernetes are optimal places for deploying model servers. However, managing them directly can be a complex task in a large-scale environment. In this article, you'll learn how the OpenVINO Model Server Operator can make it straightforward.
Operator installation
The operator can be easily installed from the OpenShift console. Just navigate to the OperatorHub menu (Figure 2), search for OpenVINO™ Toolkit Operator, then click the Install button.

Weston 11.0.0 release.  Weston is the reference compositor for the Wayland display server protocol.  Vlad looks at features of the release, including some things that are being deprecated and removed, as well as features coming in Weston 12. 

Color management infrastructure code has landed that allows HDR [high dynamic range] characteristics to be delivered to an HDR-capable monitor by setting-up HDR metadata in a weston.ini configuration file and delivering that to KMS [kernel mode setting]. Once Weston gains the ability to produce HDR content in a future version, it will come naturally supported.

This new version brings in multiple RDP [remote desktop protocol] improvements, like clipboard pasting, various keyboard language support, bumped support for a newer version of FreeRDP library, and many more other improvements and fixes.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Flexible array members (FAM) is an extension of C89 standardized in C99. This article discusses how flexible array members offer convenience and improve performance and how compiler implementations can generate complications.
FAM makes it possible to declare a struct with a dynamic size while keeping a flat memory layout. This is a textbook example:
struct fam {

     int size;

     double data[ ];

};
The data array starts empty and will be loaded later, perhaps many times. Presumably, the programmer uses the size member to hold the current number of elements and updates that variable with each change to the data size.
Flexible array members vs. pointer implementation
Flexible array members allow faster allocation, better locality, and solid code generation. The feature is an alternative…]]></summary>

Range based for loop with an initializer
Iterators
Algorithms
Ranges and views
See examples below:



     
    


Let’s start with the following code; we’d like to print a std::vector in reverse:
std::vector vec { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 };

	Yeah, maybe it's marginally bigger than the historical average for
	this time of the release cycle, but it definitely isn't some

engineering. The core logic of the Linux kernel is written entirely in
C (with a bit of assembly), as are its drivers and modules. While C is
rightfully celebrated for
its powerful yet simple semantics, it is an older language that lacks
many of the features present in modern languages such as
Rust. The
BPF subsystem, on the other hand,
provides a programming environment that allows engineers to write
programs that can run safely in kernel space. At the 2022 Linux Plumbers

of how BPF has evolved over the years to provide a new model for kernel

Version 17.0 of the platform includes dynamic routing for both the control and data planes. This lets you deploy a cluster in a pure layer-3 (L3) data center, overcoming the scaling issues of traditional layer-2 (L2) infrastructures such as large failure domains, large broadcast traffic, or long convergence times in the event of failures.
This article will illustrate this new feature by outlining a simple three-rack spine and leaf topology, where the layer-2 boundaries are within each rack on the Red Hat OpenStack Platform. The control plane spans the three racks, and each rack also hosts a compute node. Figure 1 illustrates our topology.

As part of our commitment to helping all developers grow on our platform, at Google Play we have various programs focused on supporting small games studios. A few weeks ago we announced the winners of the Indie Games Festival in Europe, Korea and Japan, and the 2022 class of the Indie Games Accelerator.

Today, we are launching the Indie Games Fund in Latin America. We will be awarding $2 million dollars in non-dilutive cash awards, in addition to hands-on support, to selected small games studios based in LATAM, to help them build and grow their businesses on Google Play.
The program is open to indie game developers who have already launched a game - whether it’s on Google Play or another mobile platform, PC or console. Each selected recipient will get between $150,000 and $200,000 dollars to help them take their game to the next level, and build successful businesses.
Check out all eligibility criteria and apply now. Priority will be given to applications received by 12:00 p.m. BRT, 31 October, 2022. 
For more updates about all our programs, resources and tools for indie game developers, follow us on Twitter @GooglePlayBiz and Google Play business community on LinkedIn.

when using Verilog’s simulation semantics.  Let me therefore share some
problems I’ve come across, together with my proposed solution for them.
The Problems
Today’s problem stems from logic like the following:
always @(trigger_condition)
begin
	if (some_other_condition_determining_relevance)
	begin
		#1;
		state_variable = complex_expression;
		// This then continues for another 50 lines or so

end


In general, this comes to me in “working” simulation code that’s been handed
down to me to maintain.  The simulations that use this logic often take hours
to run, and so debugging this sort of thing can be very time consuming.
(Costly too–my hourly rate isn’t cheap.)

But few people credit two deeply buried technologies for making the internet possible: hashing and cryptography.
If more people understood the role these technologies play, more money and expertise would go toward uncovering and repairing security flaws. For instance, we probably would have fixed the Heartbleed programming error much earlier and avoided widespread vulnerabilities in encrypted traffic.
This article briefly explains where hashing and cryptography come from, how they accomplish what they do, and their indelible effect on the modern internet.

detailed review of the state of Wayland compared to X.org.


	It feels fantastic. It even made my software cursor
	not feel so softwarey, which I’ve never experienced with a software
	cursor before. I have a pretty bad GPU, but on a higher end card
	you’d get a huge benefit to this in games. If your card can render
	the game many times faster than your monitor refresh rate, you can
	unlock your FPS in the game, tune your max_render_time to the
	absolute minimum, and get EXTREMELY low latency while still having
	absolutely no screen tearing whatsoever.
	
	And like, this is the first time I’ve ever seen the vsync setting
	in a game actually sync the game up with the vblank interval in a
	way that matters. It works for games in wine. It’s amazing. I have
	never experienced gaming on Linux that looked this smooth in my

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this article, I’ll show another technique that avoids mixing signed and unsigned types.
In my article Integer Conversions and Safe Comparisons in C++20 we learned about cmp_* integer comparison functions that allow us to compare various types of integer types. The functions are safe because they help with mixing signed and unsigned types. In C++20, there’s another handy feature: the non-member std::ssize() function that returns a signed number of elements in a container.
Let’s see how to use it.



     
    


C++20 offers many ways to avoid working with raw array/container indices:
Algorithms (they can avoid raw loops),
Ranges and views (for example, views::reverse),
Iterators,
Range based for loop with an initializer (for example, to update the index count).

C programs routinely suffer from memory management problems. For several years, a _FORTIFY_SOURCE preprocessor macro inserted error detection to address these problems at compile time and run time. To add an extra level of security, _FORTIFY_SOURCE=3 has been in the GNU C Library (glibc) since version 2.34. I described its mechanisms in my previous blog post, Broadening compiler checks for buffer overflows in _FORTIFY_SOURCE. There has been compiler support for this builtin in Clang for some time. Compiler support has also been available for GCC since the release of version 12 in May 2022. The new mitigation…]]></summary>

developers tend to think.  The range covered by a pointer of that size
seems to be nearly infinite.  During the Kernel Summit track at the 2022 Linux Plumbers Conference, Matthew
Wilcox took the stage to make the point that 64 bits may turn out to
be too few — and sooner than we think.  It is not too early to start
planning for 128-bit Linux systems, which he termed "ZettaLinux", and we
don't want to find ourselves wishing we'd started sooner.]]></summary>

TL;DR: If you’re attending @DrupalConEur submit your URL @ https://bit.ly/CWV-DrupalCon-22 to get your UX & performance right on #Drupal at the Tag1 & Google interactive workshop.


Getting your User Experience right, which includes performance, is critical for success. It’s a key driver of many success metrics (https://web.dev/tags/web-vitals) and a factor taken into account by platforms, including search engines, that surface links to your site (https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/experience/page-experience).
Quantifying User Experience is not always easy, so one way to measure, track and improve it is by using Core Web Vitals (CWV, https://web.dev/vitals/). Building a site with great CWV on Drupal is easier than on many platforms on average (https://bit.ly/CWV-tech-report) and yet there are certain tips and pitfalls you should be aware of.  
In this workshop the team from Tag1 and Google (Michael Meyers, Andrey Lipattsev and others) will use real life examples of Drupal-based websites to illustrate some common pain points and the corresponding solutions. If you would like us to take a look at your website and provide actionable advice, please submit the URL via this link (https://bit.ly/CWV-DrupalCon-22). The Workshop is interactive, so bring your laptop - we'll get you up and running and teach you hands-on how to code for the relevant improvements.
We cannot guarantee that all the submissions will be analysed as this depends on the number of submissions and the time that we have. However, we will make sure that all the major themes cutting across the submitted sites will be covered with relevant solutions.
See you in Prague!

https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2021/05/fuzzing-ios-code-on-macos-at-native.html
본 포스팅에서는 해당 글에 대한 약간의 번역 + 내 나름대로의 분석 + 실험을 해보려고 한다.
우선 Samuel에 따르면 macOS에 존재하지 않는 iOS 관련 런타임 라이브러리와 프레임웍들이 /System/iOSSupport 형태로 제공되기 때문에 대부분 호환이 가능할 것으로 전망했다. 
그렇다면 이를 이용하면 단순히 애플리케이션 형태 뿐만 아니라, iOS용 바이너리와 라이브러리 파일들도 macOS에서 구동할 수 있을 것이다. 이렇게 된다면 iOS용으로 컴파일된 상용 프로그램을 퍼징할 때 보다 성능이 좋은 macOS 컴퓨터에서 수행할 수 있다는 장점이 있다. 그리고 iOS 코드를 동적으로 분석하는 경우에도 보다 용이한 환경이 제공된다.
우리의 목표는 임의의 iOS용 바이너리와 라이브러리들을 iOS와 동일한 수준으로 macOS환경에서 직접 구동할 것이다. 이를 실험하기 위해 몇가지 코드를 테스트할 것이다. 기본적으로 실험에 사용된 환경은 SIP(System Inte…]]></summary>

	To solve this problem, we turned to a long-discussed idea on the

	auxiliary list of mtime data alongside a pack containing
	just unreachable objects. To garbage collect a repository, Git
	places the unreachable objects in a pack. That pack is designated
	as a “cruft pack” because Git also writes the mtime data
	corresponding to each object in a separate file alongside that

As the smart home industry prepares for a major shift in usability and interoperability with Matter launching later this year, we are working to help you build more devices and connections with Google products and beyond. 
At Google I/O this year, we shared updates on how Google is continuing to support smart home developers, including the launch of our new and improved Google Home Developer Center. Today, we are excited to share that the Google Home Developer Console is now in Developer Preview at console.home.google.com.

two-year-old CVE, but such is the case for a recent
Python release of four versions of the language.  The bug is a
denial of service (DoS) that can be caused by converting enormous numbers to
strings—or vice versa—but it was not deemed serious enough to fix
when it 
was first 
reported.  Evidently more recent reports, including a remote exploit of the
bug, have raised its importance—causing a rushed-out fix.  But the

For instance, using regular expressions, you could find all the instances of the word cat in a document, or all instances of a word that begins with c and ends with t.
Use of regular expressions in the real world can get much more complex—and powerful—than that. For example, imagine you need to write code verifying that all content in the body of an HTTP POST request is free of script injection attacks. Malicious code can appear in any number of ways, but you know that injected script code will always appear between  HTML tags. You can apply the regular expression .*, which matches any block of code text bracketed by  tags, to the …]]></summary>

It’s official: new emoji are here, there, and everywhere.
But what exactly is “new” and where is “here”? Great question. 
Emoji have long eclipsed their humble beginnings in sms text messages in the 1990’s. Today, they appear in places you'd never expect like self-checkout kiosks, television screens and yes, even refrigerators 😂. As emoji increase in popularity and advance in how they are used, the Noto Emoji project has stepped up our emoji game to help everyone get “🫠” without having to buy a new device (or a new refrigerator).

The release process for 3.3.0 continued. José Armando García Sancio published the first release candidate on August 29. A few issues, including KAFKA-14187 and KAFKA-14156, were found during testing, so José built RC1 on September 1. The vote is currently ongoing. You can find the release plan in the wiki.

Kevin Davin speaking at the SnowCamp Conference in 2019


Kevin Davin has always had a passion for learning and helping others learn, no matter their background or unique challenges they may face. He explains, “I want to learn something new every day, I want to help others learn, and I’m addicted to learning.” This mantra is evident in everything he does from giving talks at numerous conferences to helping people from underrepresented groups overcome imposter syndrome and even helping them become GDEs. In addition to learning, Kevin is also passionate about diversity and inclusion efforts, partly inspired by navigating the world with partial blindness.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes, If you mix different integer types in an expression, you might end up with tricky cases. For example, comparing long with size_t might give different results than long with unsigned short. C++20 brings some help, and there’s no need to learn all the complex rules :)



     
    


Let’s have a look at two comparisons:
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    long a = -100;
    unsigned short b = 100;
    std::cout << (a < b);   // 1
    size_t c = 100;
    std::cout << (a < c);   // 2
}   


If you run the code @Compiler Explorer (GCC 12, x86-64, default flags) you’ll see:
10


Why? Why not 11?
(By the way, I asked that question on Twitter, see https://twitter.com/fenbf/status/1568566458333990914 - thank you for all the answers and hints)

significantly, which is why the kernel has a "transparent huge page"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[기본적으로 Apple iOS앱들은 암호화(Encrypted) 되어 있을 수 있다. 하지만 아무리 보안을 위해 암호화를 했다하더라도, 실행을 하기 위해서는 반드시 암호화를 해제한 상태로 구동을 하게 된다. 이 시점에 복호화된 애플리케이션을 덤프해서 원본 IPA를 획득할 수 있을 것이다.
이런 경우에 사용되는 도구가 frida-ios-dump이다.
https://github.com/AloneMonkey/frida-ios-dump

사전 준비 
이 글에서는 사전준비가 미리 되어있다고 가정하겠다. 필요한 부분은 이전 블로그 게시글을 확인하면 좋다.
- 탈옥한 iphone : https://cpuu.postype.com/post/10436260
- frida 도구 설치 방법 : https://cpuu.postype.com/post/10415747


Frida-ios-dump 설치
% git clone https://github.com/AloneMonkey/frida-ios-dump.git
% cd frida-ios-dump/
% pip3 install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
설치가 완료되면 dump.py 파일이 존재하는데, 여기에서 아래의 정보를 알맞게 입력해야 한다.
User = 'root'
Password = 'alpine'
Host = 'IP주소'
Port = 22
탈옥된 아이폰이 root 계정 비밀번호가 alpine 이라고 할 때, 동일한 네트워크라면 192 또는 172로 시작하는 주소를 찾아서 입력하면 되고, ssh port 도 기본은 22 이지만 필요한 경우 알맞게 변경하면 된다.


애플리케이션 추출
dump 파이썬 스크립트에서 -l 옵션을 이용한다.
또는 frida-ps 를 사용해도 같다.


이렇게 확인된 Identifier 값을 입력하면 된다. 참고로 덤프를 할 때 해당 디바이스는 화면 잠금이 해제된 상태여야만 작업이 진행된다.


추출된 IPA 파일은 사실상 압축된 형태의 내용으로, unzip 명령어를 사용하면 해제가 가능하다.
% unzip unc0ver.ipa
디렉토리 내부에 보면 arm64 형식의 Mach-O 바이너리 파일을 획득할 수 있다.
% file unc0ver
unc0ver: Mach-O 64-bit executable arm64
리버스 엔지니어링을 하면 된다.

 A medical game for doctors, a language game for kids, a scary game for horror lovers and an escape room game for thrill seekers! In this latest batch of #WeArePlay stories, we’re celebrating the founders behind a wonderful variety of games from all over the world. Have a read and get gaming! 

To start, let’s meet Sam from Chicago. Coming from a family of doctors, his Dad challenged him to make a game to help those in the medical field. Sam agreed, made a game and months later discovered over 100,000 doctors were able to practice medical procedures. This early success inspired him to found Level Ex - a company of 135, making world-class medical games for doctors across the globe. Despite his achievements, his Dad still hopes Sam may one day get into medicine himself and clinch a Nobel prize.   




Next, a few more stories from around the world:

Aldo and Sandro from Peru - founders of Dark Dome. They combine storytelling and art to make thrilling and chilling games, filled with plot twists and jump scares.






Vladimir, Tomislav and Boris from Croatia - founders of Pine Studio. They won the Indie Games Festival 2021 with their game Cats In Time. 





Kelly, Mikk, Reimo and Madde from Estonia - founders of ALPA kids. Their language games for children have a huge impact on early education and language preservation.





Check out all the stories now at g.co/play/weareplay and stay tuned for even more coming soon.

modules from various locations (and the modules they import) get added
into the application process.  All of that occurs before the application
even gets started doing whatever it is the user actually launched it for;
that delay can be significant—and annoying.  Beyond that, many of those
imports may not be necessary at all for the code path being followed, so
eagerly doing the import is purely wasted time.  A proposal back in May
would add a way for applications to choose lazy imports, where the import
is deferred until the module is actually used.]]></summary>

Converting between int and str in bases other than 2 (binary), 4, 8 (octal), 16 (hexadecimal), or 32 such as base 10 (decimal) now raises a ValueError if the number of digits in string form is above a limit to avoid potential denial of service attacks due to the algorithmic complexity.
Security releases for 3.9.14, 3.8.14, and 3.7.14 are made available simultaneously to address this issue, along with some less urgent security content.
Upgrading your installations is highly recommended.

When adopting GitOps, organizations must plan carefully to divide tasks and configuration files appropriately between repositories and directories in each repository. Standard practices have long existed for using Git-based workflows for infrastructure and software delivery. But with the dawn of cloud-native architectures and Kubernetes, you can now automate a wide range of deployments based on declarations stored in a Git repository.
The question of best practices comes up a lot when creating repositories for GitOps. There is no magic bullet, but several common patterns exist to match the various ways the organization interacts internally.

You can download the demo code from its GitHub repository.
The package contains:
An echo server listening on the Unix socket /tmp/librabc
A Rust crate that connects to the socket and sends a ping packet every 2
seconds
A C/Python binding
A command-line interface (CLI) for the client
The CI system of this GitHub repository is built on Gith…]]></summary>

우선 실험환경은 Apple Silicon 버전의 일명 M1 macmini 이고 macOS Monterey(12.5) 운영체제 환경이다.


개발 환경 구축
기본적으로 컴파일 및 여러가지 진행을 위해 터미널에서 아래의 명령어로 관련 도구를 설치한다.
% xcode-select --install
명령어를 입력하면 화면에 위와 같은 메시지가 뜨고, 설치를 눌러 진행한다.


설치 완료후 아래와 같이 현재 도구 버전을 확인해볼 수 있다.
% xcode-select --version
xcode-select version 2395. 
% gcc --version          
Apple clang version 13.1.6 (clang-1316.0.21.2.5)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Peter Eckersley, one of the original founders of the Let's Encrypt non-profit TLS certificate authority, has died suddenly, as reported by Seth Schoen:

Peter was the leader of EFF's contributions to Let's Encrypt and ACME over the course of several years during which these technologies turned from a wild idea into an important part of Internet infrastructure. He also took a lot of initiative in coalescing the EFF, Mozilla, and University of Michigan teams into a single team and a single project. He later served on the initial board of directors of the Internet Security Research Group.
[...]
Toward the end of his life, Peter focused his career on ethics and safety of artificial intelligence, and he founded the AI Objectives Institute to examine the concrete parallels he saw between surprising and undesirable outcomes that can emerge within economies and those that can emerge in machine learning systems.


More about Eckersley can be found at his web site, on his Wikipedia page, and in a Hacker News discussion.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a beginner or immediate C++ programmer, you heard never mixing unsigned and signed integer types or avoiding unsigned integers at all. There was also this talk about undefined behaviour. Yet, in embedded software development, there is no way around unsigned integers – so what is behind all these warnings? Wonderful that you strive to...]]></summary>

just been released and proclaimed ready for production use.


	When we defined our set of milestones, we defined Arti 1.0.0 as
	"ready for production use": You should be able to use it in the
	real world, to get a similar degree of privacy, usability, and
	stability to what you would with a C client Tor. The APIs should be
	(more or less) stable for embedders.

	We believe we have achieved this. You can now use arti

pages are in a bit of an interesting position.  They 
are managed as a separate project, distinct from the kernel's
documentation, and have the task of documenting both the kernel's
system-call interface and the wrappers for that interface provided by the C
library.  Sometimes the two objectives come into conflict, as can be seen
in a discussion that has been playing out over the course of the last year
on whether to use C standard type names to describe kernel-defined
