	And I know some people will wonder why we spent so much time

	that NVidia is the market leader, especially in the professional
	Linux workstation space, and there are lot of people who either
	would end up not using Linux or using Linux with X without it,

at the difficulties caused by the OpenSSL 3 transition in the
context of Alpine Linux.


	For distributions, however, the story is different:
	cryptography moved to using Rust, because they wanted to
	leverage all of the static analysis capabilities built into the
	language.  This, too, is a reasonable decision, from a development
	perspective.  From the ecosystem perspective, however, it is
	problematic, as the Rust ecosystem is still rapidly evolving, and
	so we cannot support a single branch of the Rust compiler for an
	entire 2 year lifecycle, which means it exists in community.  Our
	solution, historically, has been to hold cryptography at
	the latest version that did not require Rust to build.  However,
	that version is not compatible with OpenSSL 3, and so it will
	eventually need to be upgraded to a new version which is.  And so,
	since cryptography has to move to community, so does
	paramiko and Ansible.]]></summary>

There seems to be a lot of confusion around the implementation of C++20 coroutines, which I think is due to the draft technical specification for C++20 stating that coroutines are a work in progress so we can’t expect full compiler and library support at this point in time.

Years ago, OpenBSD gained two new security system calls, pledge(2)
(originally tame(2)) and unveil. In both, an application
surrenders capabilities at run-time. The idea is to perform initialization
like usual, then drop capabilities before handling untrusted input,
limiting unwanted side effects. This feature is applicable even where type
safety isn’t an issue, such as Python, where a program might still get
tricked into accessing sensitive files or making network connections when
it shouldn’t. So how can a Python program access these system calls?
As discussed previously, it’s quite easy to access C APIs from
Python through its ctypes package, and this is no exception.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My friend over at Possibly Wrong created a code name generator. By
coincidence I happened to be thinking about code names myself while
recently replaying XCOM: Enemy Within (2012/2013). The game
generates a random code name for each mission, and I wondered how often it
repeats. The UFOpaedia page on the topic gives the word lists: 53
adjectives and 76 nouns, for a total of 4028 possible code names. A
typical game has around 60 missions, and if code names are generated
naively on the fly, then per the birthday paradox around half of all games
will see a repeated mission code name! Fortunately this is easy to avoid,
and the particular configuration here lends itself to an interesting
implementation.
Mission code names are built using “adjective noun”. Some examples
from the game’s word list:…]]></summary>

How the idea emerged
With the advancement of technology, drones have become not only smaller, but also have more compute. There are many examples of iPhone-sized quadcopters in the consumer drone market and the computing power to do live tracking while recording 4K video. However, the most important element has not changed much - the controller. It is still bulky and not intuitive for beginners to use. There is a smartphone with on-display control as an option; however, the control principle is still the same.

Between eighty and ninety percent (80%-90%) of a modern application is assembled from open source software components. An SBOM [software bill of materials] accounts for the software components contained in an application — open source, proprietary, or third-party — and details their provenance, license, and security attributes. SBOMs are used as a part of a foundational practice to track and trace components across software supply chains. SBOMs also help to proactively identify software issues and risks and establish a starting point for their remediation.

track to be pulled into the mainline during the 5.15 merge window.  Matthew
Wilcox duly sent a pull
request in August to make that happen.  While it is possible that
folios could still end up in 5.15, that has not happened as of this writing
and appears increasingly unlikely.  What we got instead was a lengthy
discussion on the merits of the folio approach.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This blog post by
Loris Cro makes the claim that the Zig
language  is
the solution to a lot of low-level programming problems:


	Freeing the art of systems programming from the grips of C/C++
	cruft is the only way to push for real change in our industry, but
	rewriting everything is not the answer. In the Zig project we’re
	making the C/C++ ecosystem more fun and productive. Today we have a
	compiler, a linker and a build system, and soon we’ll also have a
	package manager, making Zig a complete toolchain that can fetch
	dependencies and build C/C++/Zig projects from any target, for any
	target.


(LWN looked at Zig last year).]]></summary>

guidelines and suggestions for code that is going into the standard
library, but the "rules" in the PEP have been applied in settings and tools well outside of that

version-number jump (from 1.1.1) reflects a new versioning scheme.


	Most applications that worked with OpenSSL 1.1.1 will still work
	unchanged and will simply need to be recompiled (although you may
	see numerous compilation warnings about using deprecated
	APIs). Some applications may need to make changes to compile and
	work correctly, and many applications will need to be changed to
	avoid the deprecations warnings. We have put together a migration 
	guide to describe the major differences in OpenSSL 3.0 compared to
	previous releases.


OpenSSL has also been relicensed to Apache 2.0, which should end the era of
"special exceptions" needed to use OpenSSL in GPL-licensed applications.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Once upon a time, block storage devices were slow, to the point that they
often limited the speed of the system as a whole.  A great deal of effort
went into carefully ordering requests to get the best performance out of
the storage device; achieving that goal was well worth expending some CPU
time.  But then storage devices got much faster and the equation changed.
Fancy I/O-scheduling mechanisms have fallen by the wayside and effort is now
focused on optimizing code so that the CPU can keep up with its storage.  A
block-layer change that was merged for the 5.15 kernel shows the kinds of
tradeoffs that must be made to get the best performance from current hardware.]]></summary>

They describe the process of integrating a project into OSS-Fuzz, and discuss their findings, which include more than 2000 bugs (500+ security relevant), of which 1300+ have been fixed at this point:

Throughout the process we integrated projects written in C, C++, Python, Go and Rust and the types of bugs we found across the projects are a reflection of the language the project was written in. Typically, for managed languages the bugs are within the umbrella term of uncaught exceptions and denial of service bugs, whereas in native languages the bugs are mostly split between assert violations, NULL-dereferences, heap-out-of-bounds, stack-out-of-bounds, stack overflows, integer arithmetic, memory leaks, out-of-memory and timeout bugs.]]></summary>

years.  Changes of that nature tend to be somewhat contentious in the Emacs
community, pitting the "old guard" that values the existing features (and
keybindings) against those who argue for changes to make Emacs more
approachable (and aesthetically pleasing) to newcomers.  Those discussions
tend toward mega-thread status, so it should be no surprise that a query
about possibly moving Emacs development to a "forge" (e.g. GitHub or GitLab) got
similar treatment.  As always in Emacs-land, there are multiple facets to
the discussion, including the desirability of moving away from an
email-based workflow, accommodating younger, forge-centric developers
without forcing existing developers into that model, and—naturally—licensing.]]></summary>

Python 3.9.7 is the newest major stable release of 
the Python programming language, and it contains many new features and 
optimizations. There’s been 187 commits since 3.9.6 which is a similar 
amount compared to 3.8 at the same stage of the release cycle. See the change log for details.

On macOS, we encourage you to use the universal2 binary installer variant whenever possible. The legacy 10.9+ Intel-only variant will not be provided for Python 3.10 and the universal2 variant will become the default download for 3.9.8. You may need to upgrade third-party components, like pip,
 to later versions. You may experience differences in behavior in IDLE

Let’s look at use cases, required features to make it work, and finally, one significant limitation that we might want to solve in the future.
Sidenote: is my code run at constexpr?
Before we dive into fun stuff with vectors, it would be good to set some background.
In short: even if your function is marked with constexpr, it doesn’t mean it will always be executed at compile-time.
constexpr function can be both executed at compile-time and runtime.
For example:

	So I realize you must all still be busy with all the galas and
	fancy balls and all the other 30th anniversary events, but at some
	point you must be getting tired of the constant glitz, the
	fireworks, and the champagne. That ball gown or tailcoat isn't the
	most comfortable thing, either. The celebrations will go on for a
	few more weeks yet, but you all may just need a breather from them.

	And when that happens, I have just the thing for you - a new kernel
	release to test and enjoy.


Headline features in 5.14 include:
core scheduling (at last),
the burstable CFS bandwidth controller,
some initial infrastructure for BPF program
loaders,
the rq_qos
I/O priority policy,
some improvements to the
SO_REUSEPORT networking option,
the control-group "kill" button,
the memfd_secret() system call,
the quotactl_fd() system call,
and much more.  See the LWN merge-window summaries (part 1, part 2) for more details.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A question I get asked with some frequency is: why bother measuring X, why not build something instead? More bluntly, in a recent conversation with a newsletter author, his comment on some future measurement projects I wanted to do (in the same vein as other projects like keyboard vs. mouse, keyboard, terminal and end-to-end latency measurements) was, "so you just want to get to the top of Hacker News?"
The implication for the former is that measuring is less valuable than building and for the latter that measuring isn't valuable at all (perhaps other than for fame), but I don't see measuring as lesser let alone worthless. If anything, because measurement is, like writing, not generally valued, it's much easier to find high ROI measurement projects than high ROI building projects.

drivers without much concern for the availability of any associated
user-space code.  What happens in user space is beyond the kernel's concern
and unaffected by the kernel's license.  There is an exception, though, in
the form of drivers for graphical processors (GPUs), which cannot be merged
in the absence of a working, freely-licensed user-space component.  The
question of which drivers are subject to that rule has come up a few times
in recent years; that discussion has now come to a decision point with an

interface (ABI) was not changed, which is the usual test for a patch to get
reverted, but the report still led to a reversion.  The change did lead to
problems building a user-space application because it moved some header
files to staging/ as part of a cleanup for a deprecated—though
apparently still functioning—driver for a Digital
Video Broadcasting (DVB) device.  There are a few different issues
tangled together here, but the reversion of a regression in the user-space

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first installment in this two-part
series looked at the difficulties that arise when Btrfs filesystems
containing subvolumes are exported via NFS.  Btrfs has a couple of quirks
that complicate life in this situation: the use of separate device numbers
for subvolumes and the lack of unique inode numbers across the filesystem
as a whole.  Recently, Neil Brown set off on an effort to try
to solve these problems, only to discover that the situation was even
more difficult than expected and that many attempts would be required.]]></summary>

In this blog post, you’ll learn how to optimize your classes' layout and make some data members “disappear”. In most cases, it will be just one line of C++20 code.
Let’s go.
A motivating example
unique_ptr is one of the most useful smart pointers and is also easy to use. It’s very flexible as you can even control the way the deleter works.
I wrote an article on that topic some time ago:
Custom Deleters for C++ Smart Pointers - unique_ptr
To recall the knowledge, let’s have a look at an example. There’s a legacy type LegacyList, and the users are obligated to call ReleaseElements before the list is deleted:

platforms, and with alternative implementations. Each has its
own quirks and oddities that can shake bugs out earlier. C is particularly
good at this since it has such a wide selection of compilers and runs on
everything. For instance I count at least 7 distinct C compilers in Debian
alone. One advantage of writing portable software is access to a
broader testing environment, and it’s one reason I prefer to target
standards rather than specific platforms.
However, I’ve long struggled with architecture diversity. My work and
testing has been almost entirely on x86, with ARM as a distant second
(Raspberry Pi and friends). Big endian hosts are particularly rare.
