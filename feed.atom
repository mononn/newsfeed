Incorrect use of virtual functions is a classic mistake. Developers often use virtual functions incorrectly. In this article, we discuss this classic mistake. I suppose the reader is familiar with virtual functions in C++. Let's get straight to the point. When we call a virtual function in a constructor, the function is overridden only within a base class or a currently created class. Constructors in the derived classes have not yet been called. Therefore, the virtual functions implemented in them will not be called. Let me illustrate this.]]></summary>

Far from being a limitation, the realization gave him a new perspective on his intellectual strengths—such as his ability to perceive mathematical concepts in a highly visual way and his capacity for logical thinking and computer programming. “I was reborn…]]></summary>

With C++20, we get a handy way of initializing data members. The new feature is called designated initializers and might be familiar to C programmers.
Let’s have a look at this small feature:
The basics
Designated Initialization is a form of Aggregate Initialization.
As of C++20, an Aggregate type::
is an array type or,
is a class type that:

has no private or protected direct non-static data members
has no user-declared or inherited constructors
has no virtual, private, or protected base classes
has no virtual member functions
In a basic form in C++20, you can write:
Type obj = { .designator = val, .designator = val2, ... };
// or
Type obj = { .designator { val }, .designator { val2 }, ... };

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here's a list of errors on this blog that I think were fairly serious. While what I think of as serious is, of course, subjective, I don't think there's any reasonable way to avoid that because, e.g., I make a huge number of typos, so many that the majority of acknowledgements on many posts are for people who e-mailed or DM'ed me typo fixes.
A list that included everything, including typos would both be uninteresting for other people to read as well as high overhead for me, which is why I've drawn the line somewhere. An example of an error I don't think of as serious is, in this post on how I learned to program, I originally had the dates wrong on when the competition programmers from my high school made money (it was a couple years after I thought it was). In that case, and many others, I…]]></summary>

It's even cooler when people are ready to continue the development of such projects! In this article, we check TheXTech with PVS-Studio. TheXTech is an open implementation of the game from the Super Mario universe. TheXTech is the SMBX 1.3. game engine rewritten on C++. The original SMBX (Super Mario Bros. X) was written on Visual Basic 6 by Andrew Spinks in 2009. It allows to create levels from the elements of the Nintendo's Super Mario Bros games. TheXTech accurately reproduces the original game's behavior. It also includes optional bug fixes. It runs not only on Windows, but also on macOS, and Linux systems with x86, ARM or PowerPC processors. Some developers also ported it on 3DS and PS Vista The TheXTech developer — Vitaliy Novichkov (Wohlstand) — described the development process in detail on Habr. He also described the techniques he used to smooth out the differences when porting the project from VB6 to C++. There's a disclaimer on the GitHub page that explains why the source code is not in the best condition. It's because the original code is unstructured something fierce. Its fragments you'll see below.]]></summary>

Annotations provide more information about functions during errors detecting. CARLA is an impressive open-source project in C++ that helped us implement this mechanism to our analyzer. Subsequently, the simulator became a test-target for the improved PVS-Studio static analyzer. CARLA is an open-source simulator for autonomous driving research. CARLA has been developed from the ground up to support development, training, and validation of autonomous driving systems. In addition to open-source code and protocols, CARLA provides open digital assets (urban layouts, buildings, vehicles) that were created for this purpose and can be used freely. The simulation platform supports flexible specification of sensor suites and environmental conditions. The project is cross-platform and contains almost 78,000 lines of C++ code.

relicensing update presentation at the 2021 LLVM Developer’s meeting.
The very short summary is that we are currently in the long tail phase of
collecting relicensing agreements of past contributors. We already at the time
of this writing have more than 94% of older code relicensed. We hope to crowd
source getting through the long tail to get as close to 100% as possible.
Call for help
You can help by looking through the list of remaining individuals and
corporations we need to get agreements

about where packets originate, where they are bound, and when they are sent. 
Mix networks are
meant to hide that metadata by routing packets through various intermediate
nodes to try to thwart the traffic analysis used by nation-state-level
adversaries to identify "opponents" of various kinds. Tor is perhaps the
best-known mix network, but there are others that make different
tradeoffs to increase the security of their users.  Rollercoaster

 Google’s Business Messages let customers message a business directly from Google Search, Google Maps, and any brand-managed property. Developers of Business Messages can leverage tools like Dialogflow to create AI-powered conversational experiences, where customers can chat with lifelike virtual agents that understand, interact, and talk in natural ways. Meanwhile the business can leverage real life agents when needed. 
In this article, I’ll give a brief overview of Business Messages, how to get started developing with the platform, and then walkthrough how to set up an AI-powered conversion using the Bot-in-a-Box feature.

Python 3.9.9 is the eighth maintenance release of the legacy 3.9 series. Python 3.10 is now the latest feature release series of Python 3. Get the latest release of 3.10.x here.

3.9.9 was released out of schedule as a hotfix for an argparse regression in Python 3.9.8 which caused complex command-line tools to fail recognizing sub-commands properly. Details in BPO-45235. There are only three other bugfixes in this release compared to 3.9.8. See the changelog for details on what changed.

Upgrading to 3.9.9 is highly recommended if you’re running Python 3.9.8.

The next Python 3.9 maintenance release will be 3.9.10, currently scheduled for 2022-01-03.

We apologize for the inconvenience

…and still hope you’ll enjoy the new release!

Your friendly release team,

     Merchant Center lets merchants manage how their in-store and online product     inventory appears on Google. It allows them to reach hundreds of millions     of people looking to buy products like yours each day. 

    To upload their products, merchants can make use of feeds, that is, files     with a list of products in a specific format. These can be shared with     Merchant Center in different ways: using Google Sheets, SFTP or FTP shares,     Google Cloud Storage or manually through the user interface.

https://github.com/google/syzkaller/
syzkaller 는 QEMU 기반으로 운영체제를 부팅한 후 Host 와 Guest 사이에 ssh 연결을 수립하고 system call fuzzing 을 수행하는 도구다. 일반적으로 syzkaller 는 x86 리눅스 위에서 테스트 대상 x86 리눅스를 QEMU로 테스트하는 방식으로 많이 사용된다. 그러나 이 글에서는 Aarch64 리눅스를 테스트하고자 한다.
전체적인 과정은 공식 메뉴얼을 따랐지만, 설명이 친절한 편이 아니어서 직접 삽질을 하면서 다시 정리해보았다.


1. Kernel Build (with KASAN)
테스트 하고자 하는 리눅스 커널을 빌드한다. 앞선 글에서 설명했으나, 그때는 별다른 보안 옵션을 설정하지 않았다. 지금은 KASAN, KCOV 등의 새니타이징 기능을 켜고 퍼즈 테스트 성능을 측정할 수 있도록 하는 부분이 다르다. 
일단 x86에서 진행하는 것이라면 크로스 컴파일을 통해 Aarch64 리눅스 커널을 빌드할 필요성이 있다. 크로스 컴파일을 위한 툴 체인을 받아야 한다.

Let’s bring the example and have a look at how this feature works for ordered containers.
If you have the following code:

Individuals matter.
A pattern I've repeatedly seen during the roadmap creation and review process is that people will plan out the next few quarters of work and then assign some number of people to it, one person for one quarter to a project, two people for three quarters to another, etc. Nominally, this process enables teams to understand what other teams are doing and plan appropriately.

        <updated>2021-11-12T17:49:13.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over on the Google Security blog, Jonathan Metzman announced the release of ClusterFuzzLite, which is "a continuous fuzzing solution that runs as part of CI/CD workflows to find vulnerabilities faster than ever before".   ClusterFuzzLite is a descendant of OSS-Fuzz, which we looked at in 2017.

Large projects including systemd and curl are already using ClusterFuzzLite during code review, with positive results. According to Daniel Stenberg, author of curl, “When the human reviewers nod and have approved the code and your static code analyzers and linters can't detect any more issues, fuzzing is what takes you to the next level of code maturity and robustness. OSS-Fuzz and ClusterFuzzLite help us maintain curl as a quality project, around the clock, every day and every commit.”

[...] To learn more, check out the ClusterFuzzLite documentation. ClusterFuzzLite currently supports GitHub Actions, Google Cloud Build and Prow. We built this with CI system extensibility in mind, and adding support for other CI systems is straightforward. Please contact us if you’re interested in contributing support, or have any questions, feedback or feature requests.]]></summary>

아직 초보인데, Defenit팀의 김현우(V4bel)님께서 인프런에서 진행하시는 강좌가 정말 큰 도움이 되었다.
https://www.inflearn.com/course/%EB%A6%AC%EB%88%85%EC%8A%A4-%EC%BB%A4%EB%84%90-%ED%95%B4%ED%82%B9/
해당 강좌는 Intel x86_64 환경을 기준으로 되어있는데, 이를 Aarch64 리눅스로 하여 열심히 삽질 중이다. 변환했을 때 똑같이 적용되는 것도 있고, 안 되는 것도 많다..


우선 Aarch64 환경에서 커널 빌드 및 디버깅을 하기 위한 절차를 기록해둔다. 대부분의 내용은 위에서 언급한 강좌에서 김현우님께서 가이드해주신 방법을 참고했으며, Aarch64 로 변환할 때 필요한 수정사항들을 내가 작성했다(이 게시물은 강사님의 허락을 받고 기록해두는 것이다.)
 
(참고로 1~3번 과정을 생략하고, 내가 올려둔 파일을 다운로드 하셔도 됨)
1. 리눅스 커널 빌드
우선 리눅스 커널을 직접 빌드할 수 있는 환경이 마련되어야 한다. 강의에서는 인텔 리눅스 상에서 인텔 리눅스를 빌드하는 방식으로 진행되었다. 그러나 Aarch64 아키텍처용 리눅스를 빌드하려면 방법이 달라진다. 대략 두가지 방법이 있다.
1) Intel 리눅스상에서 cross-compiler 를 사용해서 Aarch64 리눅스 이미지를 빌드하는 방법.
2) Aarch64 리눅스 상에서 Aarch64 리눅스를 빌드하는 방법.
그동안은 대부분 1의 방법이 선호되었다. 왜냐…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On November 10, the Go programming language community celebrated the 12th anniversary of its release as open-source software.  The post covers a number of different topics, including the consolidation of web sites at go.dev, releases and their features over the last year, as well as a look to the future:

In February, the Go 1.18 release will expand the new register-based calling convention to non-x86 architectures, bringing dramatic performance improvements with it. It will include the new Go fuzzing support. And it will be the first release to include support for generics.

Generics will be one of our focuses for 2022. The initial release in Go 1.18 is only the beginning. We need to spend time using generics and learning what works and what doesn’t, so that we can write best practices and decide what should be added to the standard library and other libraries. We expect that Go 1.19 (expected in August 2022) and later releases will further refine the design and implementation of generics as well as integrating them further into the overall Go experience.]]></summary>

    regularly work together on common goals are able to communicate regularly
    and negotiate changes quickly. These teams exhibit a strong force of
    alignment, and can make technology and design decisions that harness that
    strong force. As we zoom out in a larger organisation an increasingly
    weak force exists between teams and divisions that work independently
    and have less frequent collaboration. Recognising the differences in these
    strong and weak forces allows us to make better decisions and give better

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Within each normal-sized team, limit the choice of alternatives for any class
	of technology to three. These are: the current sensible default, the one we're
	experimenting with as a trial, and the one that we hate and want to retire.
The conversation goes like this: We want to introduce a new messaging
  technology. How many do we have already in place? Oh we have three in active
  use, including one that's considered legacy and we're partway through
  migrating off and one that we experimented with previously but didn't gain
  traction. Ok, so we're at our limit now. If we want to add another messaging
  tech then we have two choices. Either migrate all of our apps off the legacy
  tech, or properly rid ourselves of the failed experiment. This is quite
  closely related to the idea of capping the number of Innovation Tokens in
  use within your teams.
At a team level these kinds of limits are relatively easy
  to maintain and discuss and act upon, because we have common priorities and
  ways of working and high trust, high bandwidth communication. At the scope of
  the whole organisation the challenge is similar, but getting alignment takes a
  lot longer and doing actual migration and consolidation work can take a long
  time - so we sometimes have to allow for more variation in technology. We also use 
  different techniques to discuss and communicate the status of our preferred technologies.
An approach we use at MYOB to engage our whole organisation in broader decisions about
  technology is by publishing our own MYOB Technology Radar, following the
  format of the Thoughtworks Technology Radar.
  This approach of building our own radar
  involves taking input from all of our verticals and teams, and making a clear
  statement on what technologies we encourage teams to adopt, trial, or more
  importantly which ones to keep clear of.]]></summary>

Nowadays, you can find various static analyzers: from free open-source to cross-functional commercial solutions. On the one hand, it's great – you can choose from many options. On the other hand – you have to perform advanced research to find the right tool for your team. Before we talk about selection criteria, let's briefly discuss the methodology. Static analysis is an automated method to find errors in source code by means of specialized programs. The purpose of such analysis is to identify unsafe and problem parts of the project that can lead to more serious consequences – vulnerabilities. Keep in mind that users are not QA engineers. Bugs must not get into the release. That is why it's better to use a static analyzer regularly. Run the analyzer once – get lots of messages. Believe us, you don't want to sort them out. Moreover, to find and fix some errors you have to use more expensive methods at the following project stages.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tools to improve and control code quality can be a key success factor in a complex software project implementation. Static analyzers belong to such tools. Nowadays, you can find various static analyzers: from free open-source to cross-functional commercial solutions. On the one hand, it's great – you can choose from many options. On the other hand – you have to perform advanced research to find the right tool for your team. Before we talk about selection criteria, let's briefly discuss the methodology. Static analysis is an automated method to find errors in source code by means of specialized programs. The purpose of such analysis is to identify unsafe and problem parts of the project that can lead to more serious consequences – vulnerabilities. Keep in mind that users are not QA engineers. Bugs must not get into the release. That is why it's better to use a static analyzer regularly. Run the analyzer once – get lots of messages. Believe us, you don't want to sort them out. Moreover, to find and fix some errors you have to use more expensive methods at the following project stages.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Julia programming language has
its roots in high-performance scientific computing, so it is no surprise
that it has facilities for concurrent processing. Those features are not
well-known outside of the Julia community, though, so it is interesting to
see the different types of parallel and concurrent computation that the
language supports. In addition, the upcoming release of Julia
version 1.7 brings an improvement to the language's
concurrent-computation palette, 
in the form of "task 
migration".]]></summary>

6 Ways to Refactor new/delete into unique ptr - C++ Stories
Basic assumptions
The code presented here will usually contain explicit new and delete, and we’d like to reduce their use and wrap resources (pointers) into RAII.

optimization work has continued since then, and those 3.5 million IOPS
would be a deeply disappointing result now.  A recent disagreement over the
addition of a new feature has highlighted the potential cost of a heavily
optimized block layer, though; when is a feature deemed important enough to

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over at the SAMBA+ blog, the performance of the new ksmbd kernel SMB server and Samba in user space are compared:

ksmbd claims performance improvements on a wide range of benchmarks: the graphs on this page show a doubling of performance on some tests. There was also the notion that an in-kernel server is likely an easier place to support SMB Direct, which uses RDMA to transfer data between systems.

Clearly, those number are impressive, but at the same time recent improvements in Samba's IO performance put this into perspective: by leveraging the new "io_uring" Linux API Samba is able to provide roughly 10x the throughput compared to ksmbd.

Time will tell whether it's better to reside in kernel-space like ksmbd or in user-space like Samba in order to squeeze the last bit of performance out of the available hardware.


There are two graphs that show some impressive results for Samba.]]></summary>

the process of starting a program on Linux in great detail.



	Well, __libc_start_main calls __libc_init_first,
	who immediately uses secret inside information to find the
	environment variables just after the terminating null of the
	argument vector and then sets a global variable __environ
	which __libc_start_main uses thereafter whenever it needs
	it including when it calls main. After the envp
	is established, then __libc_start_main uses the same trick
	and surprise! Just past the terminating null at the end of the
	envp array, there's another vector, the ELF auxiliary
	vector the loader uses to pass some information to the process. An
	easy way to see what's in there is to set the environment variable
	LD_SHOW_AUXV=1 before running the program.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mach-O 는 macOS에서 사용하는 바이너리 형식 포맷이다. 기존에는 애플도 인텔 칩셋을 사용했기 때문에 바이너리도 인텔용 바이너리로 사용되었다.
그러나 2020년 M1칩을 발표하면서부터 macOS는 ARM64로 전환되었고, 이에 따라 바이너리 형식 역시 ARM64를 따르게 되었다. 물론 원래부터 iOS를 구동하는 아이폰 및 아이패드가 ARM 디바이스였으므로 완전히 새로운 내용은 아니다. 다만 성능 차원에서 훨씬 뛰어난데다가 컴퓨터용 운영체제인 macOS가 ARM64를 지원하게 되었고, 2021년 계속해서 M1 Max 등 새로운 칩셋들을 계속 ARM64로 고수하고 있으므로 향후에는 결국 ARM64 기반의 Mach-O가 완전히 자리잡을 것으로 보인다.
한편 M1 칩셋 환경을 대상으로 하는 M1 악성코드가 출현하고 있다(참고 : GoSearch22). 그러므로 M1 환경에서 악성코드 분석이라던지 취약점 분석을 하기 위해서는 M1용 바이너리를 역공학(reverse engineering) 하는 방법을 필수적으로 숙지해야 할 것이다.
물론 리버싱 실무에서 사실상의 표준 도구로 사용되는 IDA Pro 같은 경우 이미 ARM64 macOS 에 대한 지원 업데이트를 출시했다. .. 역시 자본주의 사회에서는 돈이 .. 최고다..  이 글에서는 IDA를 사용하지 않고, 순수하게 디스어셈블 도구를 사용하여 어셈블리 언어 수준의 분석을 수행해보는 것으로 한다.
