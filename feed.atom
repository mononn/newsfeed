        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Python has lots of different options for mutable data structures, both
directly in 
the language and in the standard library. Lists, dictionaries (or "dicts"), and
sets are the foundation, but two of those maintain an order based on how
the elements are added, while sets do not.  A recent discussion on the Python Discourse forum raised the
idea of adding an ordered variant of sets; while it does not look like
there is a big push to add the feature, the discussion did show some of
what is generally needed to get new things into the language—and could well
lead to its inclusion.]]></summary>

summary of the Netfilter workshop that was recently held in Seville.
"This year, the number of participants was just eight people, and this
allowed the setup to be a bit more informal. We had kind of an
un-conference style meeting, in which whoever had something prepared just
went ahead and opened a topic for debate."

detailed specification for a new approach to "trusted computing"
systems.


	Central to the proposed design is the concept of a Unified Kernel
	Image (UKI). These UKIs are the combination of a Linux kernel
	image, and initrd, a UEFI boot stub program (and further resources,
	see below) into one single UEFI PE file that can either be directly
	invoked by the UEFI firmware (which is useful in particular in some
	cloud/Confidential Computing environments) or through a boot loader
	(which is generally useful to implement support for multiple kernel
	versions, with interactive or automatic selection of image to boot
	into, potentially with automatic fallback management to increase
	robustness).


This work is evidently the first in a series that will come out of the
newly formed Linux Userspace API

CRDs specify how to install, monitor, and manage resources, whereas Operators are agents that actually carry all that out. The usual language for writing an Operator is Go.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In September and October, I had the pleasure of running two meetings about C++20 features for my local Cracow C++ User Group!
Here are the slides and additional comments from the presentation.



     
    


Initially I did one presentation using my article on smaller C++ 20 features (20 Smaller yet Handy C++20 Features - C++ Stories). Thanks to many valuable discussions during the talk, we decided to do a split. The first meeting was about language parts, and the second part was about library changes.

While the list of topics is in a similar order as the article, I made a few changes:
There’s a constinit slide with more examples instead of the Default Bitfield initializers.
More examples of various features
Additional links and references



     
    


Here are the slides @Xara:
20_cpp20_features_language
20_cpp20_features_library


And


You can also have a look at my YT channel (the C++ Stories YT channel) and see the shorter version of the presentation (around 1 hour): 20 smaller C++20 features (Improved audio) - YouTube.

statically checked for safety using the 
verifier, which analyzes the program in its
entirety before allowing it to run. While this allows BPF programs to
safely run in kernel space, it restricts how that program is able to use
pointers. Until recently, one such constraint was that the size of a memory
region referenced by a pointer in a BPF program must be statically known
when a BPF program is loaded. A recent
patch set by Joanne Koong enhances BPF to support loading programs with

APIs are now one of the most popular ways for applications, microservices, and containers to communicate. They offer a wide range of benefits, including reliable communication and data transfer, streamlined development, easy scalability, and cost-effective re-usability. However, as APIs become more prevalent in the cloud-native landscape, they also leave applications vulnerable to many more security risks.
APIs can expose an application and its data, greatly expanding the attack surface and providing a range of new opportunities for attacks. Since APIs are used for communication and data transfer, an insecure API can expose sensitive customer or corporate data, causing reve…]]></summary>

What is CI/CD and why is it important for developers?
Continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) are development processes making use of automated tools to produce high-quality software.
CI ensures that any code submitted by each developer works together with all other code in the project. Typically, CI works by running regression tests.
CD involves further automation to make sure that the latest accepted versions of a project enter production, and that all the pieces deployed together are compatible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since its inclusion in the Linux kernel, the WireGuard VPN tunnel has become
increasingly popular.  In general, WireGuard is simpler to configure than
other VPNs, but the approach that it takes to authentication can present
some challenges. Each node in a WireGuard network has a cryptographic key
that serves as the node's identity; 
nodes that do not know each other's keys cannot directly communicate.
Keeping
track of these keys and distributing them to the other nodes
in a mesh network quickly becomes a chore as the network grows.
Fortunately, there are now 
several open-source 
tools that can automate the management of these keys and make using
WireGuard easier for both administrators and end users.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apache Kafka Streams allow you to implement event-driven and event streaming applications in a distributed environment. Red Hat OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka takes those capabilities to the next level by eliminating the complexity and management involved in implementing and maintaining Kafka instances.
If you're using Amazon Web Services (AWS) to host your Red Hat OpenShift cluster or Red Hat OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka, you'll be pleased to know that the AWS Marketplace now offers Red Hat OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka for AWS (Figure 1).

  


          


This Kafka installation is managed by Red Hat, freeing you to focus on developing code instead of maintaining infrastructure. The service also works alongside the Service Binding Operator in OpenShift. Once you install the Operator, connecting your code to a Kafka instance can be as simple as drag and drop (Figure 2).

  


          


The Service Binding Operator also makes it easy to experiment with these technologies by running our Managed Kafka sandbox activity in an existing OpenShift cluster on AWS.
Finally; if you have already created the Sandbox Activity in our sandbox, and want to move it to your AWS cluster, check out the GitOps Primer Operator, which gives you the ability to export all Kubernetes objects within a namespace as a portable zip file that can be easily taken to another cluster.
Happy coding!

The story of a reused Go error variable
A user opened a new issue to ACME Corporation because he noticed that users could enter any string into the phone number on the contact form. Wile E. is in charge of implementing a fix.
Wile E. examines the code:

the existence of yet another new operating system, called KataOS, aimed at
the creation of secure embedded systems.


	As the foundation for this new operating system, we chose seL4 as
	the microkernel because it puts security front and center; it is
	mathematically proven secure, with guaranteed confidentiality,
	integrity, and availability. Through the seL4 CAmkES framework,
	we're also able to provide statically-defined and analyzable system
	components. KataOS provides a verifiably-secure platform that
	protects the user's privacy because it is logically impossible for
	applications to breach the kernel's hardware security protections
	and the system components are verifiably secure. KataOS is also
	implemented almost entirely in Rust, which provides a strong
	starting point for software security, since it eliminates entire
	classes of bugs, such as off-by-one errors and buffer overflows.]]></summary>

the 6.1 release, but one of the changes that has received the most
attention will also have the least short-term effect for users of the
kernel: the introduction of support for the Rust programming language.  No
system with a production 6.1 kernel will be running any Rust code, but this
change does give kernel developers a chance to play with the language in
the kernel context and get a sense for how Rust development feels.  Perhaps
the most likely conclusion for most developers, though, will be that there

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Helm is the most popular package manager that finds, shares, and deploys software built for Kubernetes. It would be best if you packaged Java applications as Helm charts containing all of the necessary metadata and resource definitions to configure them for distribution through Helm. This article introduces the Dekorate Helm extension as an easier way to generate and maintain Helm chart resources.
What are Helm charts?
A Helm chart is a collection of files inside a directory. The following files are mandatory:
Chart.yaml: Chart metadata, such as name, version, and developers.
values.yaml: Default configuration values for the chart in YAML.
templates: A directory containing the list of resources that, combined with values.yaml, generate the application when the chart is installed. The resou…]]></summary>

well-aligned to my interests. It’s given me a lot of new, interesting

Dandelions (full rules), an asymmetric paper-and-pencil game
invented by the book’s author, Ben Orlin. Just as with British Square two
years ago — and essentially following the same technique — I wrote a
program that explores the game tree sufficiently to play either side
perfectly, “solving” the game in its standard 5-by-5 configuration.
The source: dandelions.c
The game is played on a 5-by-5 grid where one player plays the dandelions,
the other plays the wind. Players alternate, dandelions placing flowers

The article also introduced the Kryptonite for Kafka project, which integrates with Apache Kafka Connect to achieve automatic encryption and decryption with no changes to application code.
This article, the second and last in this series, contains more advanced examples that cover a common scenario: File-based data integration between different kinds of storage. I'll show Kryptonite for Kafka features that support fine-grained, field-level encryption in this use case.
To keep things simple in the examples, a local file system serves as the source while the sink is set up in MinIO (Figure 1), an open source object storage service compatible with AWS S3.

In that article, you learned that the .repo files stored in the /etc/yum.repos.d directory of the local machine play a critical role in discovering, installing, and managing RPM packages.
This article goes to the next level of detail to describe the format specified for a .repo file.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A package manager makes it simple to install GNU/Linux applications on a local computer. Before package management became commonplace, installing applications was a tedious, error-prone undertaking. The ease a package manager brings to installing an application on a Linux computer has been a major factor contributing to the widespread adoption of Linux as a mainstream operating system for both business and home users.
Package management under Linux is divided, however. Two major systems co-exist:
The APT package management system for Debian and its many derivatives, notably Ubuntu. Packages are marked with the .deb suffix and are managed through the apt command-line interface (CLI).

A typical big enterprise with multiple development teams might build hundreds of APIs that they would want to reuse internally or share with partners that build complementary applications. If the teams cannot discover existing APIs, they might build a new API with the same functionality, which leads to duplication of efforts and underutilization of the existing API. It is also an unscalable practice to contact the API developer each time someone wants to use the API.
There needs to be a better and more hands-off way for internal teams and partners to discover and understand the usage of these APIs without directly contacting the developers who built t…]]></summary>

lengthy article on the Network Time Protocol and its creator David
Mills.


	Coders sometimes joke, morbidly, about the “bus factor.” How many
	people need to get hit by a bus before a given project is
	endangered? It’s difficult to determine the bus factor for N.T.P.,
	and time synchronization more broadly, especially now that
	companies such as Google have developed their own N.T.P.-inspired

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mahmoud Al-Qudsi provides
extensive details on what it takes to implement a safe semaphore type
in the Rust language.


	The problem is that with n > 1, there’s no concept of a
	“privileged” owning thread and all threads that have “obtained” the
	semaphore do so equally. Therefore, a rust semaphore can only ever
	provide read-only (&T) access to an underlying resource,
	limiting the usefulness of such a semaphore almost to the point of
	having no utility. As such, the only safe “owning” semaphore with
	read-write access that can exist in the rust world would be
	Semaphore<()>, or one that actually owns no data and can
	only be used for its side effect of limiting concurrency while the
	semaphore is “owned,” so to speak.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Go has a nifty synchronization utility called a WaitGroup, on which
one or more goroutines can wait for concurrent task completion. In other
languages, the usual task completion convention is joining threads doing
the work. In Go, goroutines aren’t values and lack handles, so a WaitGroup
replaces joins. Building a WaitGroup using typical, portable primitives is
a messy affair involving constructors and destructors, managing lifetimes.
However, on at least Linux and Windows, we can build a WaitGroup out of a
zero-initialized integer, much like my 32-bit queue and 32-bit
barrier.
In case you’re not familiar with it, a typical WaitGroup use case in Go:

var wg sync.WaitGroup
for _, task := range tasks {
    wg.Add(1)
    go func(t Task) {
        // ... do task ...
        wg.Done()

Most users never need to go beyond using the dnf or yum install commands, which we reviewed in an earlier article, Move from apt to dnf package management. These commands hide the complexity of what's going on underneath the covers during the installation process. But when things go wrong with an installation, it's useful to understand how RPM goes about locating and installing applications, at least for debugging purposes.

that its latency is unacceptably high for the realtime Linux kernel; at
this point, printk() represents the last piece needing changes
before the 
RT_PREEMPT patches can be fully merged.  So there have been efforts
to rework printk() for latency and lots of other reasons, but
those have not made it into the mainline; a recent discussion at

debuggers and fuzzing. I typically have at least one sanitizer
active during development. They’re particularly useful during code review,
where they can identify issues before I’ve even begun examining the code

good idea to have your own code in good agreement with sanitizers before
review. For ThreadSanitizer (TSan), that means dealing with false
positives in programs relying on synchronization invisible to TSan.
This article’s motivation is multi-threaded epoll. I mitigate TSan

	But of course there's a lot of various changes in 6.0 - we've got

	such 6.0 is one of the bigger releases at least in numbers of
	commits in a while.


Headline features in 6.0 include
a number of io_uring improvements including support for buffered writes to
XFS filesystems and zero-copy network
transmission,
an io_uring-based block driver mechanism,
the runtime verification subsystem,
and much more; see
the LWN merge-window summaries (part 1,

Red Hat OpenShift and Kubernetes are optimal places for deploying model servers. However, managing them directly can be a complex task in a large-scale environment. In this article, you'll learn how the OpenVINO Model Server Operator can make it straightforward.

Color management infrastructure code has landed that allows HDR [high dynamic range] characteristics to be delivered to an HDR-capable monitor by setting-up HDR metadata in a weston.ini configuration file and delivering that to KMS [kernel mode setting]. Once Weston gains the ability to produce HDR content in a future version, it will come naturally supported.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Flexible array members (FAM) is an extension of C89 standardized in C99. This article discusses how flexible array members offer convenience and improve performance and how compiler implementations can generate complications.
FAM makes it possible to declare a struct with a dynamic size while keeping a flat memory layout. This is a textbook example:
struct fam {

     int size;

     double data[ ];

};
The data array starts empty and will be loaded later, perhaps many times. Presumably, the programmer uses the size member to hold the current number of elements and updates that variable with each change to the data size.
Flexible array members vs. pointer implementation
Flexible array members allow faster allocation, better locality, and solid code generation. The feature is an alternative…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Andrey Konovalov began his 2022 Linux
Security Summit Europe (LSS EU) talk with a bold statement: "fuzzing is
useless".  As might be guessed, he qualified that assertion quickly by
adding "without dynamic bug detectors".   These bug detectors include
"sanitizers" of various sorts, such as the Kernel Address
Sanitizer (KASAN), but there are others. Konovalov looked in detail at KASAN
and gave an overview of the
sanitizer landscape along with some ideas of ways to push these bug
detectors further—to find even more kernel bugs.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Version 5.2 of the bash shell has been released.


	The most notable new feature is the rewritten command substitution
	parsing code, which calls the bison parser recursively. This
	replaces the ad-hoc parsing used in previous versions, and allows
	better syntax checking and catches syntax errors much earlier. The
	shell attempts to do a much better job of parsing and expanding
	array subscripts only once; this has visible effects in the `unset'
	builtin, word expansions, conditional commands, and other builtins
	that can assign variable values as a side effect.]]></summary>

Rust and why it is interesting.


	Conversations around "why async" often focus on performance - a
	topic which is highly dependent on workloads, and results with
	people wholly talking past each other. While performance is not a
	bad reason to choose async Rust, we often we only notice
	performance when we experience a lack of it. So I want to instead
