grouped into nodes, each of which has memory attached to it.  All memory in
the system is accessible from all CPUs, but memory attached to the local
node is faster.  The kernel's memory-policy
("mempolicy") interface allows threads to inform the kernel about how
they would like their memory placed to get the best performance.  In recent
years, the NUMA concept has been extended to support the management of
different types of memory in a system, pushing the limits of the mempolicy
subsystem.  In a remotely presented session at the 2024 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit, Gregory Price discussed
the ways in which the kernel's memory-policy support should evolve to
handle today's more-complex systems.]]></summary>

a white
paper looking at the security-relevant bug fixes applied (or not
applied) to the RHEL 8.x kernel over time.


	This means that over time, the security of the RHEL kernels get
	worse and worse as more issues are discovered in the upstream code
	and are potentially exploitable but fewer and fewer of the fixes
	for these known bugs are back-ported into RHEL kernels.

	After reaching RHEL 8.7, the theory is that the kernel has been
	stabilized, with a corresponding improvement in security. However
	we still have an influx of newly discovered bugs in the upstream
	kernel affecting RHEL 8.7 that are not addressed. Each minor
	version of upstream is released on an approximately quarterly basis
	and we can see that the influx of new bugs that are unaddressed in
	RHEL is growing. The number of known issues in these kernels
	increases by approximately 250 new bugs per quarter or more.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Butane (formerly the Fedora CoreOS Config Transpiler, or FCCT) is a command-line utility that is used to generate human readable configuration into Ignition configuration files. Butane is an open source repo maintained by CoreOS, and contributed to and enhanced by many. If you take a look at the Butane repo and look in the Config folder, you can almost see some of the stakeholders. These are configurations which are used to target different platforms (i.e., FCOS, Flatcar Container Linux, Red Hat OpenShift, etc.) Each of these configurations will have a stable and experimental phase that also targets stable and experimental specs of Ignition. I would describe these as levers that a contributor can exercise to impact the functionality they want to expose to the end users of these target plat…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Given a problem with an application in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (RHOCP 4) upon opening a case with the support team, our support team might ask for a namespace’s inspect file. The inspect file is a very useful tool for troubleshooting applications and systems deployed in RHOCP 4 and can be extremely useful in a series of situations.
It also avoids the unnecessarily separated collection of data (Pod Logs, route YAML, BuildConfig YAMLs) given it brings everything that is namespace bounded—except custom resources—directly to one goal. 
This article covers what the inspect file is, how to collect it, how to use it for troubleshooting, and how it compares to the must-gather file (spoiler: it is not the same thing). This will help clarify why we usually ask for this file during the t…]]></summary>

	In 2014, ESET researchers said the 2011 attack likely infected

	code library that, when installed, created a backdoor in OpenSSH

	months, starting in August 2011, Ebury spread to 25,000

of the Arch-based Manjaro distribution is now available with
the 6.9 kernel, GNOME 46, Xfce 4.18, and an update to the
Pamac package
installer. This is also the project's first release with KDE Plasma 6:
The Plasma edition comes with the latest Plasma 6.0 series and KDE
Gear 24.02. It brings exciting new improvements to your desktop.
With Plasma 6, KDE's technology stack has undergone major upgrades:
a transition to the latest version of application framework, Qt, and
an improved graphics platform when Wayland is used. These changes are
as smooth and unnoticeable to the users as possible. You will see the
same familiar desktop environment that you know and love. But these
under-the-hood upgrades benefit Plasma's security, efficiency, and
performance, and improve support for modern hardware. Thus Plasma
delivers an overall more reliable user experience, while paving the
way for many more improvements in the future.
The project also offers minimal install images with the 6.6 LTS
and 6.1 LTS kernels to support older hardware.]]></summary>

Mozilla has developed

In the 2.10 release of RHACM, we are introducing a new kind of policy template, OperatorPolicy, as a tech preview feature which helps manage these specific types more completely and more easily.
In this article, you’ll learn the basics of the OperatorPolicy, and you’ll see a demo about how to use it. Because this is a tech preview feature, we are looking forward to hearing your feedback about how we can improve these features for you.

This is a beta preview of Python 3.13
Python 3.13 is still in development. This release, 3.13.0b1, is the first of four beta release previews of 3.13.
Beta release previews are intended to give the wider community the 
opportunity to test new features and bug fixes and to prepare their 
projects to support the new feature release.
We strongly encourage maintainers of third-party Python projects to test with 3.13 during the beta phase and report issues found to the Python bug tracker
 as soon as possible. While the release is planned to be feature

The OpenStack Operator
The OpenStack Operator consists of three parts (a CatalogSource, an OperatorGroup, and a Subscription), each defining a different resource for managing Operators within an OpenShift/Kubernetes cluster using the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM). The resources aim to set up an Operator for OpenStack, likely for managing OpenStack services within the cluster, are as foll…]]></summary>

The InstructLab project offers an open source approach to generative AI, sourcing community contributions to support regular builds of an enhanced version of an LLM. This approach is designed to lower costs, remove barriers to testing and experimentation, and improve alignment—that is, ensuring the model's answers are accurate, unbiased, and consistent with the values and goals of its users and creators.

This method is model agnostic and does not require model fine-tuning, making Kai a versatile tool for large-scale modernization projects, demonstrated by updating a Java EE application to Quarkus using a Visual Studio Code (VS Code) plug-in. This unique approach will enable organizations to s…]]></summary>

We believe our best work is done when we work together to find new solutions. So we asked, what if an operating system could be updated via image-based transactions, and what if those images could be built and shipped like a container? What if we could use the same tools, skills, and patterns as today’s containerized applications, closing the gaps between pipeline and production? The result is a way to think differently about how to build, deploy, and manage Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Containers have used Linux since the start. But there have always been two different types of Linux: the host operating system, and the one inside each container. Each one operates independently and requires a completely different set of tools for building, managing, and configuring.
But no more! Image mode for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) allows you to build and manage a full operating system just like a container image.
What are bootable containers?
Application container base images are Open Container Initiative (OCI) container images that are usually trimmed down as far as possible, to exclude the OS kernel, hardware support, and anything else that application containers do not need when running inside of a host OS.
Bootable containers use this same OCI image format, but contain the …]]></summary>

By bringing development and operations teams together, companies achieved a dramatic boost in both speed (agility) and efficiency. But DevOps is just the first chapter. The future of software development lies in platforms. These platforms are like building blocks–scalable and reusable, enabling companies to develop and deliver software even faster and more efficiently than ever before. The best way to achieve this is by making developers happy and more productive.
Why we need platform engineering
Development and Ops teams are navigating a lot of obstacles these days. Not only are tools, frameworks, languages, data storage, and messaging systems becoming increasingly complex, but the shift to cloud environments and closer Dev/Ops integration adds ano…]]></summary>

By integrating Kubernetes with OpenStack, organizations see improved resource management and scalability, greater flexibility across the hybrid cloud, simplified development and DevOps practices, and more. 
In this article, we’ll cover some of the finer points of OpenShift for OpenStack admins, including the three Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform operators that are prerequisites: cert-manager, MetalLB, and NMstate.

In this blog post, we’ll have a look at functional/monadic extensions of std::expected, which allow us to chain operations elegantly, handling errors at the same time. The techniques are very similar to std::optional extensions - see How to Use Monadic Operations for `std::optional` in C++23 - C++ Stories.
Here’s a brief overview of these functional capabilities:

Since then, most engineers have embraced this microservices architecture. Microservices help divide a single monolithic application into small units, each acting as a service to deliver specific functions.
For companies transitioning from on-premise software to a hybrid cloud infrastructure, refactoring the application from a monolith into microservices offers several advantages. The microservice architecture isolates services, allowing companies to loosely coupled software components. This flexibility enables deploying and running specific services on premise or in the cloud as part of a hybrid setup. Consequently, companies can keep personal …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the early days of software, developers built applications by grouping all components into one self-contained code base for easy management — the monolithic approach. Then, the technology evolved from large codebases to smaller microservices, distinct components that collaborate like a specialized team.
Pedal, an app to buy bikes, embodies this transition. It’s evolving from a monolith to a network of independent microservices. However, it’s challenging to manage, monitor, and coordinate all these microservices efficiently.
Application programming interface (API) management tools help monitor and control multiple microservices from a central location while enhancing security. Like team captains, these tools help microservices collaborate while retaining their individual capabilities.

Eelco is the principal author of Nix and undoubtedly a central figure in the

perceived as or act like the BDFL [Benevolent Dictator for Life]

commit to that in a timely manner, he has decided to formally step down from the
board.



The board also announced its intent to set up new, explicit governance for the
project, answerable to the community:



We will appoint a constitutional assembly within the next 14 days.
Its task will be to set up a new governance structure, run by the
community, that is capable of serving the community's needs. Once
established, we will delegate our power to institutions within that
new structure. This entire process will take place in a public space,
such that it's traceable for anyone concerned. We are committed to

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crazy idea of the day: Static Analysis Ranked Defect List.



Here is a software analysis tool feature request/product idea: So many times we see the problem that a static analysis tool or other way of automatically finding bugs inundates developers with so many possible bugs they turn it off in frustration. Or maybe they have a requirement to ship only "clean" code so they don't run the tool because then there is nothing to clean up.  Put your favorite head-in-the-sand organizational dysfunction here.


I'd love to be able to recommend a static analysis or other tool that has a feature that reports that top 10 defects currently in the code base, ranked by likely risk. Go ahead and use machine learning for the ranking; fine with me. Regardless of methodology, fixing only some is a guess after all.


Ultimately, all the static analysis warnings should be cleaned up. Having a "top K warnings" feature would allow a team to make progress over time instead of simply sweeping the entire mess under the carpet and ignoring what is often very valuable information that predicts defect escapes to deployment.


For tools with many warnings an approximation can be to gradually turn on a series of warning flags over time and/or just run the warnings on a subset of modules. But a global "these are the 10 scariest warnings" would be a nice feature.


Thoughts?  Does some tool already do this?]]></summary>

However, in contemporary software development, the focus is shifting towards containerization, as exemplified by orchestration platforms like Kubernetes. While Kubernetes excels in abstracting the deployment environment from the host system, offering superior flexibility and resource management, it’s noteworthy that not many Kubernetes platforms currently support running VMs directly on Kubernetes.

Inline arrays
A regular C# array is a reference type that lives on the heap. Like other reference types, the garbage collector (GC) keeps track whether the array is still referenced, and it frees up memory when the array is no longer in use.
To avoid the GC overhead in performance sensitive code, when a small array is needed that is local to a function, it can be allocated on the stack using stackalloc. Thanks to the Span<T> type introduced in .NET Core 2.…]]></summary>

Before diving into its advantages, let’s first discuss some prerequisite details about container image layers and storage drivers.
Container images consist of layers which are stored and used for building and running containers. A huge benefit of this layer structure is that, assuming that each image layer stores only the differences compared to the previous layer (i.e., the delta), each layer is small which generally allows time and space savings when building and running containers. This is because small layers promotes re-usability allowing layer sharing between images and containe…]]></summary>

In short, std::expected should contain two data members: the actual expected value and the unexpected error object. So, in theory, we could use a simple structure:
template <class _Ty, class _Err>
struct expected {
    /*... lots of code ... */
    _Ty _Value;
    _Err _Unexpected;
};


However, there are better solutions than this. Here are some obvious issues for our “struct” approach.
The size of the object is the sum of the Value type and the Error type (plus padding if needed).
Two data members are “active” and initialized, which might not be possible - for example, what if the Value type has no default constructor?…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Amarok music player project
has announced
the release of version 3.0, which is codenamed "Castaway".  It is the first
stable version using Qt 5 and KDE Frameworks 5, and the first stable
release since the final Qt-4-based 2.9.0 in 2018.

The road to 3.0 has not been a short one. Much of the Qt5/KF5 porting was done in 2015 already, but finishing and polishing everything up has been a slow, sometimes ongoing and sometimes stalled process ever since. 3.0 Alpha was released in February 2021 and has been since used by many people, as have been nightly builds of git master available for various distributions. Now in the past few months, an effort was made to get everything ready for a proper 3.0 release.

Common usecases should work quite well, and in addition to fixing KF5 port
related regressions reported in pre-releases, 3.0 features many bugfixes
and implemented features for longstanding issues, the oldest such
documented being from 2009. However, with more than 20 years of development
history, it is likely that not every feature Amarok has been tested
thoroughly in the new release, and specifically some Internet services that
have changed their API in recent years are not available, at least for
now. It might well be that getting them in better state wouldn't require
huge effort, however, so if you know your way with Qt and KDE Frameworks
and your favourite Internet music service does not work with Amarok 3.0,
you are extremely welcome to join in and help!]]></summary>

intricate engineering involved in the compression and decompression of

performance pressure, video codecs have become complex and hardware

of freedom the processor has to reorder memory operations.  If low-level

complicating the portability of certain types of concurrent software.  To

In this article, we'll dive into the technical aspects of leveraging this feature, optimizing your OpenShift workflow for enhanced secret management. We will walk through a simple Spring Boot example, which will read a secret from a mount, and display the contents. This secret will be created as a sharedSecret on another namespace.

large data centers get a lot of the attention, and this year will always be
the year of the Linux desktop, there is also a great deal of Linux to be
found in realtime and embedded applications.  Two talks held in the
realtime and embedded tracks of the 2024 Open
Source Summit North America provided listeners with an update on how
Linux is doing in those areas.  Work on realtime Linux appears to be nearing
completion, while the embedded community is still pushing forward at full

been working to improve support for asynchronous
code. The benefits of these efforts are not confined to asynchronous code,
however. Members of the Rust community have been working toward adding explicit

existential types to Rust since 2017. Existential types are not a common feature
of programming languages (something

the RFC acknowledges), so the motivation for their inclusion might be somewhat
obscure.]]></summary>

LSMs, but he also did not think much of the effort to switch away from
those calls.  While it does not appear that a major course-change is in store
for LSMs, it is clear that Torvalds is not happy with the direction of that

its existence as a home and support resource for free home-automation
projects.


	 We created the Open Home Foundation to fight for the fundamental
	 principles of privacy, choice, and sustainability for smart
	 homes. And every person who lives in one.

	 Ahead of today, we've transferred over 240 projects, standards,
	 drivers, and libraries—Home Assistant, ESPHome, Zigpy, Piper,
	 Improv Wi-Fi, Wyoming, and so many more—to the Open Home
	 Foundation. This is all about looking into the future. We've done
	 this to create a bulwark against surveillance capitalism, the risk
	 of buyout, and open-source projects becoming abandonware. To an
	 extent, this protection extends even against our future selves—so
	 that smart home users can continue to benefit for years, if not
	 decades. No matter what comes.]]></summary>

In the second article, we’ll cover advanced features for specific use cases.
Collection expressions
Collection expressions are a new syntax to initialize a collection type. The syntax consists of square brackets ([, ]) that surround the collection items as shown in the following examples:
// Initialize a variable
int[] arrayOfInt = [1, 2, 3];

// Initialize an argument
Foo(["one", "two", "three"]);
These types can be initialized from a collection expression:
