— with an emphasis on "basic".  It is possible to create a "hello world"
module for 6.1, but not much can be done beyond that.  There is, however, a
lot more Rust code for the kernel out there; it's just waiting for its turn to be
reviewed and merged into the mainline.  Miguel Ojeda has now posted the next
round of Rust patches, adding to the support infrastructure in the

https://cpuu.postype.com/post/9993241https://cpuu.postype.com/post/11807930

이제 마지막으로 macOS 환경도 volatility 이용한 메모리 포렌식이 가능한지?에 대한 실험 결과이다.
실험을 진행하기 이전에 몇가지 제약사항이 있었고 아직까지 해결하지 못한 부분이 많다. 그 내용들을 몇가지 요약하자면..
1) 현재 최신 macOS 환경에 대한 메모리 포렌식은 volatility 에서 지원하지 않는다. 
2) 2021년 이후 출시되고 있는 Apple Silicon 이 탭제된 Mac 컴퓨터에 대해서는 우선 현시점에서는 불가능한 것으로 판단된다. 공식 Volatility 에서는 지원이 되지 않고, 비공식적으로 arm64를 지원하기 위한 패치를 개발하는 개개인이 존재하는 것으로 보인다. 


그렇다면 macOS 메모리 포렌식 분석을 위해 메모리 덤프, 프로파일 생성, 볼라틸리티3 사용 등을 순서대로 살펴보자.


macOS 환경에서 메모리 덤프 추출
일반적으로 윈도우는 FTK Imager 를 이용해서 쉽게 추출할 수 있고, Linux는 lime이나 avml이 존재한다. 
macOS에서는 우선 오픈소스로는 osxpmem이 있다. osxpmem 은 https://github.com/Velocidex/c-aff4/releases 에서 Release 3.2 에 해당하는 파일을 다운받으면 된다. 알려진 바로는 10.8 부터 10.15 사이의 Intel x64 …]]></summary>

OpenMP is an API consisting of compiler directives and library routines that implement high-level parallelism in C and C++ as well as Fortran. OpenMP version 5.1 was released in November 2020, and version 5.2 was released in November 2021. Support for various OpenMP 5.1 features has been added. But GCC 12 does not yet have complete support for OpenMP 5.0, and work is ongoing in GCC 13.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Open vSwitch (OvS), an open source tool for creating virtual Layer 2 networks, relies in some use cases on connection tracking. The recent 3.0.0 release of OvS included this patch series to improve multithread scalability, which makes connection tracking more efficient when OvS is run on multiple CPUs. This article shows how to measure the performance of connection tracking with OvS.
What is connection tracking and why is it critical?
Connection tracking, or conntrack, maintains an internal table of logical network connections (also called flows). The table identifies all packets that make up each flow so that they can be handled consistently.
Conntrack is a requirement for network address translation (NAT)—in IP address masquerading, for example (described in detail in RFC 3022). Conntrac…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Meta has announced
the open-source release of part of its internal source-code management
system, called Sapling.


	Sapling began 10 years ago as an initiative to make our monorepo
	scale in the face of tremendous growth. Public source control
	systems were not, and still are not, capable of handling
	repositories of this size. Breaking up the repository was also out
	of the question, as it would mean losing monorepo’s benefits, such
	as simplified dependency management and the ability to make broad
	changes quickly. Instead, we decided to go all in and make our
	source control system scale.

	Starting as an extension to the Mercurial open source project, it
	rapidly grew into a system of its own with new storage formats,
	wire protocols, algorithms, and behaviors. Our ambitions grew along
	with it, and we began thinking about how we could improve not only
	the scale but also the actual experience of using source control.


At this point, only the client side of the system has been released; the
company "hopes to" release the rest later.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the past few decades, application development has been evolving from bare metal hosting to virtualization to containers, leading to the adoption of the Kubernetes orchestration platform. This article traces these developments and explains how Red Hat OpenShift provides the next level of application support.
There has been an explosion in the modernization of application development and deployment over the past few years. Several publications such as Forbes and Business Wire quoted IDC's prediction that between 2018 to 2023 more than 500 million logical applications will be developed, which is equal to the number of applications built over the previous 40 years. In addition, businesses expect faster changes to applications.

How Knative enhances Kafka message delivery
Knative is integrated with Apache Kafka as an optimized, native broker that stores and routes events to interested consumers. The incoming cloud events are directly stored on a configurable Kafka topic and read from the same topic for message delivery when the messages are routed to a registered subscriber using a Trigger API.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whether you are using Go to write a simple console-based utility or a fancy web application, it is always helpful to reference the previous version of your software. This information is essential, especially for developers. They need to know what the source code looked like in previous versions, so they can debug any issues introduced at specific points in time.
To do that, you need a system that can control and manage different versions of the source code, such as git. Whenever you want to capture a snapshot of the program's current codebase, you run a git commit command that saves the code at that point in time. To make sure you do not overwrite a previously saved record, git creates (by default) a unique identifier, hashed with the SHA-1 algorithm, for every commit.

In this article, we’ll look at other categories of members like unique_ptr, raw pointers, references, or const members.



     
    


In my book on “C++ Initialization” I recently wrote a chapter about so-called non-regular data members.
Here’s a definition based on cppreference - regular concept
A type is regular, that is, it is copyable, default constructible, and equality comparable. It is satisfied by types that behave similarly to built-in types like int, and that are comparable with ==.
For example:
class Product {
public:    
    Product() = default;

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[한국인터넷진흥원의 사이버보안인재센터(https://academy.kisa.or.kr/main.kisa) 에서는 매년 다양한 보안 관련 교육이 개설된다. 그 중에서 "SW 개발보안 교육"이라는 항목이 있다. 
기본적으로 SW개발보안 기본과정(개발자 대상, 공무원 대상)이 있고, SW보안약점 진단원 양성과정, SW보안약점 진단원 보수교육 등으로 이루어진다. 예전에는 개발단계 교육과 설계단계 교육 등도 있었는데 코로나19 이후로 교육들이 많이 축소되고 온라인 비대면으로 전환되면서 조금씩 커리큘럼이 바뀐듯하다.


일단 이번 글에서 설명할 것은 "SW보안약점 진단원" 이라는 일종의 자격증에 대한 설명과, 시험 후기이다.


1. SW보안약점 진단원 이란?

There are several ways to bind applications to cloud services in Kubernetes and Red Hat OpenShift. The odo command-line interface (CLI) consolidates steps that developers normally have to perform manually, and abstracts away Kubernetes and OpenShift background concepts.
With odo, you can concentrate on creating applications instead of administering the cluster. The odo tool automates deployment configurations, build configurations, service routes, and other Kubernetes and OpenShift elements.
The Service Binding Operator, employed by odo, makes the application developer's life a lot easier by providing a consistent and declarative Service Binding method.

Ousterhout's talk at Netdev 0x16, he had concluded
that TCP was unsuitable for data-center environments for a variety of
reasons.  He also argued that there was no way to repair TCP so that it
could serve the needs of data-center networking.  In order for software to
be able 
to use the full potential of today's networking hardware, TCP needs to be
replaced with a protocol that is different in almost every way, he said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Static application security testing (SAST) is one of the most effective techniques to improve application security. The term covers a variety of testing techniques that analyze an application's source, bytecode, or binary code for security vulnerabilities. Typically, developers complete this analysis during the software development lifecycle of an application. Many SAST tools are mature, and the techniques have become central to secure coding. Source code is the most common target of SAST, but you can also utilize SAST on bytecode and binary code.
Binary scanning analyzes the binary itself or the result of disassembling or decompiling it. Scanning binaries can add a benefit, unlike source code scanning, which identifies vulnerabilities created by the compiler. On the other hand, the report…]]></summary>

well-known mechanism for accessing remote computers in a
secure way; thanks to its use of cryptography, nobody can alter or

These include signals, breakpoints, watchpoints, syscalls, exceptions, and more.

A breakpoint is the most useful of these events, so let me start there.

An event-driven architecture
Data integration
Distributed integration

Events play a major role in these types of applications. Events are not new, but event-driven architectures are gaining in popularity and use asynchronous message queue technologies such as RabbitMQ, Apache ActiveMQ, WebLogic, and IBM MQ. In this article, you'll learn how Apache Camel K can make it easier to develop reactive applications on Kubernetes by integrating data sources, Apache Kafka brokers, and Knative for event management.

As defenders, in-the-wild exploit samples give us important insight into what attackers are really doing. We get the “ground truth” data about the vulnerabilities and exploit techniques they’re using, which then informs our further research and guidance to security teams on what could have the biggest impact or return on investment.

generic associated types, a new let...else statement, and the
ability to break from labeled blocks:

	a goto statement, but it's not an arbitrary jump, only
	from within a block to its end. This was already possible with

Why open source planning is difficult
Many open source projects find it difficult to plan upgrades and set roadmaps because nobody is in charge of telling people what to do. The collaborative process can be a difficult mind shift for people coming from teams that have done internal development.
Roadmaps are easier for projects sponsored mainly by a single organization. Although the single organization project is open, a lead from that organization can more …]]></summary>

The change targets the C source code in the myriad of packages that the

GCC.  As might be guessed from the

Background
 App Engine initially launched in 2008, providing a suite of bundled services making it convenient for applications to access a database (Datastore), caching service (Memcache), independent task execution (Task Queue), Google Sign-In authentication (Users), or large "blob" storage (Blobstore), or other companion services. However, apps leveraging those services can only run their apps on App Engine. 
To increase app portability and help Google move towards its goal of having the most open cloud on the market, App Engine launched its 2nd-generation service in 2018, initially removing those legacy services. The newer platform allows developers to upgrade apps to the latest language runtimes, such as moving from…]]></summary>

      twitter feed there, so that folks who would rather follow me on Mastodon
      could get everything. To do this, I used moa.party.
      You have to give it credentials to access both your Twitter and Mastodon
      feeds, which is a little worrisome, but my Mastodon-aware colleagues have
      used it without problems. It allows cross-posting in either or both
      directions, but I've set it up to just go from Twitter to Mastodon. It's
      pretty simple and seems to be working. So if you'd like to follow my
      twitter feed from Mastodon, you can now do so.
I'll be monitoring the follower count for the Mastodon account. If lots
      of people follow me on Mastodon, I'll probably do more with it. So
      following my Mastodon feed is vote for me to put more effort into it. But

Earlier this year, I discovered a surprising attack surface hidden deep inside Java’s standard library: A custom JIT compiler processing untrusted XSLT programs, exposed to remote attackers during XML signature verification. This post discusses CVE-2022-34169, an integer truncation bug in this JIT compiler resulting in arbitrary code execution in many Java-based web applications and identity providers that support the SAML single-sign-on standard. 
OpenJDK fixed the discussed issue in July 2022. The Apache BCEL project used by Xalan-J, the origin of the vulnerable code, released a patch in September 2022. 

While the vulnerability discussed in this post has been patched , vendors and users should expect further vulnerabilities in SAML.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Modern applications, rarely coded from scratch, are formed by combining software components (known as subsystems) into a single system. This process is called integration. Typical subsystems include databases and web services. This article explains how Apache Camel and Kubernetes support easy integration of such services through Kamelets.
How Kamelets make Camel integration easy
Apache Camel is a popular open source integration framework based on known Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIPs). Camel is a complete, production-ready framework with a built-in set of patterns you can use in your integration flows. These patterns are based on design patterns and help connect different systems.
Developers build many frameworks on Apache Camel. This article focuses on Camel K, but several other fra…]]></summary>

The purpose of this redesign was to upgrade an existing flash controller

long.  It includes a new systemd-measure tool for the calculation of PCR
values and a bunch of infrastructure to use the result for disk encryption:


	Net effect: if you boot a properly prepared kernel, TPM-bound disk
        encryption now defaults to be locked to kernels which carry PCR
          signatures from the same key pair. Example: if a hypothetical distro
          FooOS prepares its UKIs like this, TPM-based disk encryption is now –
          by default – bound to only FooOS kernels, and encrypted volumes bound
          to the TPM cannot be unlocked on kernels from other sources.


There's a lot more; see the announcement for all of the details.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Linux security module (LSM) mechanism was created as a result of the first Kernel Summit in 2001; it was
designed to allow the development of multiple approaches to Linux security.
That goal has been met; there are several security modules available with
current kernels.  The LSM subsystem was not designed, though, to allow
multiple security modules to work together on the same system.  Developers
have been working to rectify that problem almost since the LSM subsystem
was merged, but with limited success; some small security modules can be
stacked on top of the "major" ones, but arbitrary stacking is not possible.
Now, a full 20 years after
security-module support went into the 2.5 development kernel series, it
looks like a solution to the stacking problem may finally be getting
closer.]]></summary>

testing.


	So while rc2 was just _way_ bigger than usual, rc3 is only a bit
	larger than an average rc3 release is. But it's still on the

	At its core, generic associated types allow you to have generics

	really just rounding out the places where you can put generics: for

most software of interest was written in C; as a result, distributions
are naturally able to efficiently package C applications and the libraries
they depend on.  Modern languages, though, tend to be built around their
own package-management systems that are designed with different goals in
mind.  The result is that, for years, distributors have struggled to find
the best ways to package and ship applications written in those languages.
A recent discussion in the Fedora community on the packaging of Rust

I've been spending a lot of time researching Windows authentication implementations, specifically Kerberos. In June 2022 I found an interesting issue number 2310 with the handling of RC4 encryption that allowed you to authenticate as another user if you could either interpose on the Kerberos network traffic to and from the KDC or directly if the user was configured to disable typical pre-authentication requirements.

This blog post goes into more detail on how this vulnerability works and how I was able to exploit it with only a bare minimum of brute forcing required. Note, I'm not going to spend time fully explaining how Kerberos authentication works, there's plenty of resources online.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The practice of requiring copyright assignments for contributions to
free-software projects has been in decline for years; the GNU Binutils
project may be the
latest domino to fall in that regard.  The Linux kernel project,
unlike some others, has always allowed contributors to retain their copyrights,
resulting in a code base that has widely distributed ownership.  In such a
project, who owns the copyright to a given piece of code is not always
obvious. Some
developers (or their employers) are insistent about the placement of
copyright notices in the code to document their ownership of parts of the
kernel.  A series of recent discussions within the Btrfs subsystem, though,
has made it clear that there is no project-wide policy on when these
notices are warranted — or even acceptable.]]></summary>

blog post on whether the Rust language needs to be standardized.
The answer is "no" — but she draws a distinction between a "standard"
(maintained by some distant standards body) and a "specification".



	While no official decision has been made yet, there does seem to be
	a general agreement that we should indeed work towards having and
	maintaining an official complete Rust specification from within the
	Rust project. It’s just a lot of work, so I’m afraid we won’t get
	there with just some enthusiastic volunteers, even if we can use
	the Ferrocene specification as a start. We’ll need support and

detailed specification for a new approach to "trusted computing"
systems.


	Central to the proposed design is the concept of a Unified Kernel
	Image (UKI). These UKIs are the combination of a Linux kernel
	image, and initrd, a UEFI boot stub program (and further resources,
	see below) into one single UEFI PE file that can either be directly
	invoked by the UEFI firmware (which is useful in particular in some
	cloud/Confidential Computing environments) or through a boot loader
	(which is generally useful to implement support for multiple kernel
	versions, with interactive or automatic selection of image to boot
	into, potentially with automatic fallback management to increase
	robustness).


This work is evidently the first in a series that will come out of the
newly formed Linux Userspace API

CRDs specify how to install, monitor, and manage resources, whereas Operators are agents that actually carry all that out. The usual language for writing an Operator is Go. But most Java teams prefer to keep all their code in Java: they want to avoid doing a deep dive into a new language, and to maintain a unified environment without supporting two sets of tools and practices.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In September and October, I had the pleasure of running two meetings about C++20 features for my local Cracow C++ User Group!
Here are the slides and additional comments from the presentation.



     
    


Initially I did one presentation using my article on smaller C++ 20 features (20 Smaller yet Handy C++20 Features - C++ Stories). Thanks to many valuable discussions during the talk, we decided to do a split. The first meeting was about language parts, and the second part was about library changes.

While the list of topics is in a similar order as the article, I made a few changes:
There’s a constinit slide with more examples instead of the Default Bitfield initializers.
More examples of various features
Additional links and references



     
    


Here are the slides @Xara:
20_cpp20_features_language
20_cpp20_features_library


And


You can also have a look at my YT channel (the C++ Stories YT channel) and see the shorter version of the presentation (around 1 hour): 20 smaller C++20 features (Improved audio) - YouTube.

statically checked for safety using the 
verifier, which analyzes the program in its

pointers. Until recently, one such constraint was that the size of a memory
region referenced by a pointer in a BPF program must be statically known

could create a site and publish interesting content to the world.  A few
decades later, that promise seems to have been transformed into the ability to
provide content for a small number of proprietary platforms run by huge
corporations.
But, arguably, the dream of widespread independent publishing is enjoying a

APIs are now one of the most popular ways for applications, microservices, and containers to communicate. They offer a wide range of benefits, including reliable communication and data transfer, streamlined development, easy scalability, and cost-effective re-usability. However, as APIs become more prevalent in the cloud-native landscape, they also leave applications vulnerable to many more security risks.
APIs can expose an application and its data, greatly expanding the attack surface and providing a range of new opportunities for attacks. Since APIs are used for communication and data transfer, an insecure API can expose sensitive customer or corporate data, causing reve…]]></summary>

What is CI/CD and why is it important for developers?
Continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) are development processes making use of automated tools to produce high-quality software.
CI ensures that any code submitted by each developer works together with all other code in the project. Typically, CI works by running regression tests.
CD involves further automation to make sure that the latest accepted versions of a project enter production, and that all the pieces deployed together are compatible.
