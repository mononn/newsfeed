        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When working recently on an IoT device with an LTE modem I hit the problem of a SIM card with a PIN.
Of course the PIN can be provided using the AT+CPIN command but this would require the device
to know the PIN in advance and to have some kind of mechanism to provide the PIN to the device
in the first place.
This was not an option because the device was intended to be configured over the network.
I wanted to avoid having to plug several SIMs to my phone back and forth only to disable the PIN.
There must be an obvious AT command to disable the PIN, right? It turned out not to be that easy...]]></summary>

Introduction


There is an interesting history about the Internet of Things (IoT)! National Semiconductors' (now defunct) early attempt to introduce IoT technology at the Ritz Carlton Hotel in Newport Beach in 2001 was indeed ahead of its time. The concept of IoT didn’t gain significant traction until much later, as the...]]></summary>

Rust and C code in the kernel interact: mismatched types, too many type casts,

changing the way the kernel maps C types into Rust types. The last problem was a
bit trickier, but he has a clever workaround for that, based on tricking

Instead of focusing on specifics, the model is trained to be general, allowing it to come up with creative answers, engage in complex conversations, and even display a sense of humor. Despite this, AI doesn't possess comprehension, understanding, or belief. Its responses are generated based on patterns learned from training data. 
AI systems like ChatGPT or any large language model (LLM) are reflections of humanity's collective knowledge in a single interface. These models' intelligence comes from their success as prediction machines, which allows them to emulate human interaction in a conversational format.

If a name contains values beyond ASCII — technically out of spec — then
the dynamic linker must somehow decode those octets into Unicode in order
to construct a lookup path. There are multiple ways this could be done,
and the most obvious is the process’s active code page (ACP), which is
exactly what happens. As a consequence, the specific DLL loaded by the
linker may depend on the system code page. In this article I’ll contrive
such a situation.
LoadLibraryA is a similar situation, and potentially applies the code

WordPress community, the interests of Automattic as a business, and Matt

It enables organizations to leverage Kubernetes in these environments to standardize deployments using common Kubernetes paradigms.
In this article, we will discuss managing both configuration and application deployment in MicroShift using two different approaches. The first approach is embedding GitOps and other manifests using a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) RPM. The second is using Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM) to dynamically provision GitOps manifests to manage it remotely. While both approaches are covered there will be an emphasis on the second approach.

My name is Volodymyr, and in this post I would like to talk about the project I have been working on for the past couple of months as part of Google Summer of Code 2024. The aim of the project was to introduce 3-way comparison intrinsics to LLVM IR and add a decent level of optimizations for them.
Background
Three-way comparison is an operation present in many high-level languages, such as C++ and its spaceship operator or Rust and the Ord trait. It operates on two values for which there is a defined comparison operation and returns -1 if the first operand is less than the second, 0 if they are equal, and 1 otherwise. At the moment, compilers that use LLVM express this operation using different sequences of instructions which are optimized and lowered individually rather th…]]></summary>

The Go standard library is comprehensive, containing most of what a developer needs to be productive out-of-the-box.

However, the standard library does not contain an implementation for every known cryptographic algorithm. For example, the popular bcrypt password hashing algorithm is not included in the standard library, but instead provided by the x/crypto package x/crypto/bcrypt.

interface: pointer-sized (“slim”), zero-initialized, and non-allocating.
Lacking cleanup, they compose naturally with arena allocation.
Sounds like a futex? That’s because they’re built on futexes introduced at
the same time. They’re also complemented by condition variables
with the same desirable properties. My only quibble is that slim locks
could easily have been 32-bit objects, but it hardly matters. This
article, while treating Win32 as a foreign interface, discusses a
paper-thin C++ wrapper interface around lock and condition variables, in
my own style.

Beyond the hype and the possibly over-inflated expectations that it can yield in the short term, generative artificial intelligence (gen AI) represents the beginning of a paradigm shift that changes not only how machines are programmed, but also how they are built. What was once a co-processing unit that assisted the CPU with graphics tasks has evolved into a massively parallel compute powerhorse that is now at the core of the generative AI revolution.
A previous article describes how to fine-tune Llama 3.1 models on OpenShift AI using Ray and NVIDIA GPUs. This article covers the latest generation of AMD GPUs, specifically AMD Instinct MI300X accelerators, and reviews the progress that has happened recently in the open source ecosystem that makes it …]]></summary>

the 6.12 release.  That is the lowest number of merge-window changes since
5.17-rc1 in January 2022, which brought in 11,068 changesets.  Nonetheless,
6.12 brings a number of interesting changes, many of which were included in

There have been plenty of releases in the interim, though, as can be seen in the Tcl chronology.  The 9.0 release brings 64-bit data values, better Unicode support, the ability to use zip files as filesystems, a switch to use epoll() or kqueue() where they are available, SVG support in Tk, access to notifications and other desktop-platform services in Tk, and lots more.  For more information, see the release notes for Tcl and Tk that can be downloaded as Markdown files from the announcement page. (Thanks to Matt Bradley.)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This article from last year details the steps and actions required to build and run your Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) image.
The purpose of this article is to describe the options needed for the RHEL WSL distribution so that it can be used as a Podman machine.
Requirements
To use the RHEL WSL image as a Podman machine, ensure that the following packages are installed:

podman
podman-docker
procps-ng
openssh-server
net-tools
iproute
dhcp-client
sudo
systemd-networkd

Luckily, all but the last package are available from the preconfigured RHEL 9 repositories. The last package (systemd-networkd) is available from the EPEL 9 repository and will need to be configured when building the image.
Build the image
Navigate to image builder (Figure 1).

Updated in Sept 2024: Added note about stack overflow and C++26 fixes.



     
    


If you recall from the previous article, std::initializer_list expands to some unnamed local array of const objects. So the following code might be super unsafe:

backdoor, the Debian project has revisited some of the
patches included in its OpenSSH
packages to improve security. The outcome of this is that the project
will be splitting out support for Kerberos key exchange into a
separate set of packages, though not until after the Debian 13

should be minimal, but it is an interesting look into the changes
Linux distributions make to upstream software as well as some of the

has reported a new vulnerability in 

CUPS, the software that many Linux systems use to manage printers and print jobs. Margaritelli describes the impact of the attack by saying:



A remote unauthenticated attacker can silently replace existing printers' (or install new ones) IPP urls with a malicious one, resulting in arbitrary command execution (on the computer) when a print job is started (from that computer).



The vulnerability relies on a few related problems in CUPS libraries and utilities; versions before 2.0.1 or 2.1b1 (depending on the component) may be affected.

that it has "joined forces and merged operations" with the Tails OS Linux distribution.


Countering the threat of global mass surveillance and censorship to a free Internet, Tor and Tails provide essential tools to help people around the world stay safe online. By joining forces, these two privacy advocates will pool their resources to focus on what matters most: ensuring that activists, journalists, other at-risk and everyday users will have access to improved digital security tools.

In late 2023, Tails approached the Tor Project with the idea of merging operations. Tails had outgrown its existing structure. Rather than expanding Tails's operational capacity on their own and putting more stress on Tails workers, merging with the Tor Project, with its larger and established operational framework, offered a solution. By joining forces, the Tails team can now focus on their core mission of maintaining and improving Tails OS, exploring more and complementary use cases while benefiting from the larger organizational structure of The Tor Project.]]></summary>

This is a crucial activity for disaster recovery or node failure. etcd backups are responsible for recovering the state of master nodes and the cluster state, as it is the primary datastore of Kubernetes. It is recommended to store it externally as it ensures accessibility for node restoration even if node access or the nodes themselves become unavailable.
When to back up
Ideally you should initiate the cluster’s etcd data backup regularly and store it in a secure location outside the OpenShift cluster. After creating a new OpenShift cluster, the first certificate rotation happens after 24 hours of installation; you should not start the etcd backup before this operation as it will contain expired ce…]]></summary>

post on the Google Security Blog on how switching to a memory-safe
language can quickly reduce vulnerabilities in a project, even if a large
body of older code persists.


	 This leads to two important takeaways:


    
 The problem is overwhelmingly with new code, necessitating a
    fundamental change in how we develop code. 
    
 Code matures and gets safer with time, exponentially, making the
    returns on investments like rewrites diminish over time as code gets
    older.


For example, based on the average vulnerability lifetimes, 5-year-old code
has a 3.4x (using lifetimes from the study) to 7.4x (using lifetimes
observed in Android and Chromium) lower vulnerability density than new

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Vanilla OS project has
published a
blog post to answer questions that users have raised since the release of Vanilla OS 2. The post has information about the update strategy for the distribution,
an enterprise
version with support, and plans for an experimental version called
Vanilla OS Vision.
We are not planning for a potential Vanilla OS 3 because it is not
yet necessary. As previously explained, our focus right now is on bug
fixing and making the system as solid as possible, especially in light
of collaborations with OEMs. We're all excited about laying the
foundation for a third version of Vanilla OS, but we have
responsibilities to attend to first.
This does not mean that there will never be one, nor does it mean
that Orchid will become stagnant. On the contrary, as previously
mentioned, our updates not only bring fixes but also updates to system
components, improvements to existing features, and updates to
components like GNOME (we are planning the release of GNOME 47 soon,
for example).]]></summary>

long as the conference has existed; it started back when the conference was
called LinuxCon.  Since Linus Torvalds famously does not like to give
talks, as he said during this year's edition at Open Source Summit Europe
(OSSEU) in Vienna, Austria, he and Dirk Hohndel have been sitting down for an
informal chat on a wide range of topics as a keynote session.  That way,
Torvalds does not need to prepare, but also does not know what topics
will be brought up, which makes it "so much more fun for one of us", Hohndel
said with a grin.   The topics this time ranged from the just-released 6.11
kernel and the upcoming Linux 6.12, through Rust for the kernel, to the recurring topic of succession and

Introduction 
Word embeddings are representations of text in the form of real-valued vectors. They are the foundation of several natural language processing (NLP) applications such as Retrieval Augmentation Generation. Caikit NLP is a toolkit/runtime that provides modules and exposes inference endpoints for large language models (LLMs).
In this tutorial, we will serve a Sentence Transformer model using the Caikit Standalone serving runtime. You will learn how to convert an LLM to Caikit format, deploy the model onto a serving runtime, and send requests to the served model.

so, some developers have expressed frustration at the time it takes to get

the project.  At the 2024 Maintainers Summit, Miguel Ojeda led a discussion

        <updated>2024-09-24T07:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bootable containers are a concept that has gained a lot of attention in the open source community, on Hacker News, and especially in the press since Red Hat Summit 2024. The bootc project is the core technology that enables OCI containers to encompass complete operating systems, and it is the heart of image mode for Red Hat Enterprise Linux. 
I believe that bootable containers will change how we think about the IT infrastructure of the future. To help users understand and use bootable containers, we have created a getting started guide in the upstream Fedora documentation. This post is meant to introduce you to the basic concepts and help you navigate the rest of the documentation.



  
        



  

Figure 1: Applications containers share the kernel of the underlying OS. Bootable containers include a kernel as they define the underlying OS.

Get started with bootc with video demos
To make things a bit more interactive, I have recorded a presentation based on the Fedora getting started guide.

  
      
  



  
I further sat down and recorded a hands-on demo working with bootable containers on my Mac that includes building a bootc image, running it in a VM on my machine and updating it.

  
      
  



  
Get support and share feedback
If you have any questions or feedback, feel more than welcome to join the conversation on Fedora Discussion and the bootc community.

For some compilers, like LLVM and Cranelift, there is sufficient documentation, including papers and presentations, to gain a deep understanding of their register allocators (RAs). 
Unfortunately, this is not the case for the Go compiler. To gather information about the RA in the Go compiler, I had to delve into its source code. This article outlines my findings.

Many applications consume persistent storage to save data that needs to survive beyond the life cycle of the containers. This applies to different types of workloads running on the cluster including databases, messaging systems, and big data solutions, but also for OpenShift cluster components like monitoring, logging, and the internal image registry.
There are different access modes from the Red Hat OpenShift cluster to the underlying storage solution. We can find 3 different access modes: ReadWriteMany (RWX), ReadOnlyMany (ROX), and ReadWriteOnce (RWO). Using one of them versus another depends on the application needs and on the storage exposed to the Red Ha…]]></summary>

Python provides modules and C provides libraries as a means of encapsulating code for reuse. In SystemTap we call them "tapsets". Why write everything from scratch in your SystemTap script when you can save time by using probe points and functions defined by existing tapsets? Using tapsets can also make your SystemTap script more portable as they can hide some of the variations in probe points between different versions of the code being instrumented.
Initially, I will show you where to find documentation about the set of probes and functions distributed with SystemTap as tapsets and then I will explain some of the details contained in a tapset. Other p…]]></summary>

My project is called Statistical Analysis of LLVM-IR Compilation. The objective of this project is to provide an analysis of how time is spent in the optimization pipeline. Generally, drastic differences in the percentage of time spent by a pass in the pipeline is considered abnormal.
Background
In principle, an LLVM IR bitcode file, or module, contains IR features that determine the behavior of the compiler optimization pipeline. By varying these features, the optimization pipeline, opt, can add significantly to the compilation time or marginally. More specifically, optimizations succeed in less or more time; the user can wait for a microsecond or a few minutes. LLVM compiler developers co…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, the Network Observability Operator released version 1.6, which added a major enhancement to provide network insights for your Red Hat OpenShift cluster without the Loki log aggregation system. This enhancement was described in What's new in Network Observability 1.6 article, providing a quick overview of the feature. Until this release, Loki was required to be deployed alongside Network Observability to store the network flows data. 
In this article, let's look at some of the advantages and trade-offs users would have when deploying the Network Observability Operator with Loki disabled. As more metrics are enabled by default with this feature, we'll also demonstrate a use case on how those metrics can benefit users for real world scenarios.

I find Tkinter too basic, Qt needing too much boilerplate code, and GTK (PyGobject)

pip install wxPython on all platforms.
Most applications run some kind of background tasks. If the whole application was single threaded
the GUI would freeze until the background tasks complete so a common technique is to have separate

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Four researchers have published a formal proof that Linux's new deterministic random bit generator (DRBG) is secure in a particular sense — specifically, that the number of queries that would need to be made to it to uncover its internal state depends on the quality of the entropy it can collect from different sources. As long as it can gather enough entropy, it produces secure random numbers.



Since the significant structural changes in Linux 4 and Linux 5.17, there has
been no research on the provable security of Linux-DRBG. For the first time (to
the best of our knowledge), we formally model the Linux-DRBG in Linux 6.4.8
and prove its security in the seedless robustness model

What is the Network Observability CLI?
The Network Observability CLI (oc netobserv) is a lightweight flow and packet visualization tool. It deploys a NetObserv eBPF agent and flowlogs-pipeline on your Kubernetes cluster to collect flows or packets from nodes network interfaces and streams data to a single collector for analysis and visualization. This first version of the tool allows users to capture flows or packets running a simple command. It reuses the NetObserv components without the need to install and configure operator(s).

Simply browse Hugging Face to see the latest trending models. Furthermore, the quality of LLMs has noticeably improved with newer versions of the models. You may have noticed a recent boom in AI-assisted content generation as well, with increasingly convincing degrees of expertise on a wide range of topics.
However, you also may have encountered limitations in the knowledge or accuracy of LLMs. Some very specific or esoteric knowledge that a model was not privy to in its data set during training could be missing or downright incorrect. Also, depending on when the model completed its training, a given LLM may not be up to date on current events.
Why is this the case? LLMs can take …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This summer I participated in GSoC under the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure. The goal of the project was to improve the NewGVN pass so that it can replace GVN as the main value numbering pass in LLVM.
Background
Global Value Numbering (GVN) consists of assigning value numbers such that instructions with the same value number are equivalent. NewGVN was introduced in 2016 to replace GVN. We now highlight a few aspects in which NewGVN is better than GVN.
A key advantage of NewGVN over GVN is that it is complete for loops, while GVN is only complete for acyclical code. NewGVN is complete for loops because when it first processes loops, it assumes that only the first iteration will be executed, later corroborating these assumptions—this is known as the optimistic assumption. In practice, the opti…]]></summary>
