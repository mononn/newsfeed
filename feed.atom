the path to safer flexible arrays in the kernel, thanks to the
counted_by attribute supported by Clang 18 and GCC 15.


	There are a number of requirements to properly use the
	counted_by attribute. One crucial requirement is that the
	counter must be initialized before the first reference to the
	flexible-array member. Another requirement is that the array must
	always contain at least as many elements as indicated by the
	counter.

Apps and Stacks container images can be divided into two groups: 

Source-to-Image (S2I) images 
No Source-to-Image (NoS2I) images

Source-to-Image (S2I) is a toolkit and workflow for building reproducible container images from source code.
S2I images are:

S2i-nodejs-container
S2i-php-container
S2i-ruby-container
S2i-python-container
Nginx-container
httpd-container

NoS2I images are:

Postgresql-container
Mysql-container
mariadb-container
Redis-container
varnish-container

Apps and Stacks container images support several operating systems like Fedora, CentOS Stream 8 (C8S), CentOS Stream 9 (C9S), Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8, and RHEL 9, and soon also RHEL 10. CentOS7 and RHE…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As of June 2024, Active Directory Utility for SQL Server (ADUTIL) is now officially supported with RHEL 9. SQL Server 2022 has as of July 2024 been officially certified with RHEL 9, and is now Generally Available on Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog.
The adutil tool is a command-line interface (CLI) utility for configuring and managing Windows Active Directory domains for SQL Server on Linux and containers, without switching between Windows and Linux machines to manage Active Directory. This tool was developed to ensure that users get the most out of authentication, user management, and keytab configuration in a more integrated setting.
Does this all sound good to you? Let's dive in and find out how exactly we can set up adutil on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why deploy SQL Server on Linux using an Ansible playbook? The answer is that automation is a key aspect of modern IT operations, which is why we at Red Hat are delighted to announce that the deployment and configuration of Microsoft SQL Server on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) can be easily automated using Ansible and corresponding RHEL system roles for SQL Server. You can deploy high availability (HA) solutions, including configuring Always On availability groups. Ansible scripts can automate the entire deployment process, reducing manual intervention and minimizing errors.

What is Toolbx?
Toolbx is a tool for Linux, which allows the use of interactive command line environments for software development and troubleshooting the host operating system, without having to install software on the host. It is built on top of Podman and other standard container technologies from Open Container Initiative (OCI).

Worse yet: much of it was due to neglect of secure coding practices, existing security mechanisms were disabled for no good reason. I didn’t finish that investigation because I discovered that the browser was essentially spyware, collecting your browsing history and selling it via Avast’s Jumpshot subsidiary.
But that was almost five years ago. After an initial phase of denial, Avast decided to apologize and to wind down Jumpshot.

Fortunately, image mode for RHEL takes many of the benefits that are found in container technologies, including a simplified build process and portability across a variety of environments, and applies them to traditional Virtual Machine workflows. In the prior post, Creating a VMDK using image mode for RHEL, a VMDK-formatted disk image was produced as an output from a bootc image.  
While the VMDK format is open source, they are traditionally used within the VMware family of solutions, such as VMware Workstation and VMware vSphere. In this post, we will describe how the previously created VMDK disk can be used as the basis for a virtual machine hosted in a VMware vSphere environment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Image mode for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) combines the benefits and methodologies of container technologies with the ability to operate within traditional virtual machine environments. By enabling a familiar container image assembly process that supports several popular output types, end users have the flexibility to choose where and how they want to operate.
One of the supported output formats is a Virtual Machine Disk (VMDK), which is commonly used within VMware’s supported virtualization platforms, like vSphere, but support is also available elsewhere, including VirtualBox. Bridging the gap between traditional operating environments and cloud-native technologies is one of the benefits that image mode provides.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Linus has
released
the 6.10 kernel.


	So the final week was perhaps not quite as quiet as the preceding
	ones, which I don't love - but it also wasn't noisy enough to
	warrant an extra rc.



Changes in 6.10 include
the removal of support for some ancient Alpha CPUs,
shadow-stack support for the x32 sub-architecture,
Rust-language support on RISC-V systems,
support for some Windows NT synchronization
primitives (though it is marked "broken" in 6.10),
the mseal() system call,
fsverity
support in the FUSE filesystem subsystem,
ioctl() support in the Landlock security
module,
the memory-allocation profiling subsystem,
and more.


See the LWN merge-window summaries (part 1, part 2) and the KernelNewbies 6.10 page
for more details.]]></summary>

In this post, I’ll walk you through some of the most common filesystem operations using the powerful features introduced in C++17, as well as some new enhancements in C++20/23. Whether you’re creating directories, copying files, or managing permissions, these examples will help you understand and efficiently utilize the std::filesystem library.
Let’s start.

Creating directories is a basic yet essential operation. The std::filesystem library makes this straightforward with the create_directory function.

that executive director Holly Million is stepping down at the end of
July, and will be replaced by Richard Littauer as interim executive
director:
On behalf of the whole GNOME community, the Board of Directors
would like to give our utmost thanks to Holly for her achievements
during the past 10 months, including drafting a bold five-year
strategic plan for the Foundation, securing two important fiscal
sponsorship agreements with GIMP and Black Python Devs, writing our
first funding proposal that will now enable the Foundation to apply
for more grants, vastly improving our financial operations, and
implementing a break-even budget to preserve our financial
reserves.
The Foundation's Interim Executive Director, Richard Littauer,
brings years of open source leadership as part of his work as an
organizer of SustainOSS and CURIOSS, as a sustainability coordinator
at the Open Source Initiative, and as a community development manager
at Open Source Collective, and through open source contributions to
many projects, such as Node.js and IPFS. The Board appointed Richard
in June and is confident in his ability to guide the Foundation during
this transitional period.


Million says she is leaving to pursue a PhD in psychology. The
board plans to announce its search plan for a permanent executive

Creating a heap dump on production can (and most of the time will) directly impact the Java Virtual Machine's (JVM) performance for a few seconds of applications deployed. 
To reduce the overhead of usage (i.e., overhead on data capture), one alternative is to use a lower overhead capturing framework such as Java Flight Recording (JFR) data. This data can be later analyzed offline and used to track down memory usage, high CPU utilization, and thread inspection, for example. But it can be even more useful depending on the events it records.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Doug Brown documents
the long journey to fixing a bug in the GDebi utility for
installing Debian packages. He first encountered the bug in
Ubuntu MATE 18.04: "at the time I just ignored this
issue. I didn't want to deal with it. I went off to the trusty Linux
terminal and installed Chrome that way instead".
Two and a half years ago, I committed to doing more open-source
contributions in my free time and was finally irritated enough about
this problem to look into it. I searched around for more info. Lo and
behold, lots
of people
were also
affected and there was already an
issue from 2019 on Ubuntu's bug tracker about it.
[...] As is commonly the case in software development, the difficult part of
this fix had nothing to do with the code itself. All of my effort was
spent figuring out Ubuntu's patch submission processes and advocating
for my merge request. Nobody else seemed to be interested in doing the
work to actually fix this bug that has been plaguing Ubuntu MATE and
Xubuntu, not to mention some Debian users, for over 6 years. After
dealing with the long process of getting my merge request approved, I
think I'm starting to understand why!


Brown notes that the fix is
now packaged for the upcoming Ubuntu 24.10 release, and should be
backported to 22.04 and 24.04 eventually.]]></summary>

and Fedora IoT systems installed
before Fedora 40 may fail to boot after an update if secure boot
is enabled. Fedora Magazine has a
post by Timothée Ravier about the problem, how users can work
around it, and what the project is doing to avoid the similar problems
in the future:
On Fedora Atomic Desktops and Fedora IoT systems, the components
that are part of the boot chain (Shim, GRUB) are not (yet)
automatically updated alongside the rest of the system. Thus, if you
have installed a Fedora Atomic Desktop or a Fedora IoT system before
Fedora 40, it uses an old versions of the Shim and bootloader binaries
to boot your system.
When Secure Boot is enabled, the EFI firmware loads Shim
first. Shim is signed by the Microsoft Third Party Certificate
Authority so that it can be verified on most hardware out of the
box. The Shim binary includes the Fedora certificates used to verify
binaries signed by Fedora. Then Shim loads GRUB, which in turn loads
the Linux kernel. Both are signed by Fedora.
Until recently, the kernel binaries where signed two times, with an
older key and a newer one. With the 6.9 kernel update, the kernel is
no longer signed with the old key. If GRUB or Shim is old enough and
does not know about the new key, the signature verification fails.]]></summary>

PSP security protocol (PSP) is a way to transparently encrypt packets by
efficiently offloading encryption and decryption to the network
interface cards (NICs) that Google uses for connections inside its data centers. The
protocol is similar to

IPsec, in that it allows for wrapping arbitrary traffic
in a layer of encryption. The difference is that PSP is encapsulated in UDP, and
designed from the beginning to reduce the amount of state that NICs
have to track in order to send and receive encrypted traffic, allowing for more
simultaneous connections. Jakub Kicinski

vulnerability that can be exploited for remote code execution, but only
on distributions that have applied a patch to add auditing support.
Specifically, RHEL 9 and derivatives are affected, as are
Fedora 36 and 37 (but not later releases).


	The main difference from CVE-2024-6387 is that the race condition
	and RCE potential are triggered in the privsep child process, which
	runs with reduced privileges compared to the parent server process.
	So immediate impact is lower.  However, there may be differences in
	exploitability of these vulnerabilities in a particular scenario,
	which could make either one of these a more attractive choice for
	an attacker, and if only one of these is fixed or mitigated then
	the other becomes more relevant.]]></summary>

You can deploy high availability (HA) solutions, including configuring Always On availability groups. Ansible scripts can automate the entire deployment process, reducing manual intervention and minimizing errors.

In broad strokes, OpenType added support for color fonts, variable fonts, and the Universal Shaping Engine. The Free & Open Source stack supports all of these advances at the lower level, but application UI support has been slower to arrive. The Open Source text stack also gained enormous market-share when Android and Google Chrome fully embraced it.

Looking forward, there is a Rust migration of the text stack underway, which will unify font compilation and consumption under a safe programming language. Incremental Font Transfer will enable streaming fonts to web browsers. And my proposed Wasm-fonts will enable more expressive fonts.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At DevConf.cz 2024,
Marta Lewandowska gave a talk to discuss a
new approach for booting Linux systems, "No more boot
loader: Please use the kernel instead". The talk, available on
YouTube, introduced a new project called nmbl (for "no more bootloader",
pronounced "nimble"). The idea is to get rid of bootloaders (e.g., 
GNU GRUB) with a
Unified
Kernel Image (UKI) that removes the need for a separate bootloader
altogether. It is early days for nmbl, currently the project is only
being tested for use with virtual machines, but the idea is
compelling. If successful, nmbl could offer security, performance, and
maintenance benefits compared to GRUB and other separate bootloaders.]]></summary>

to shake the screws and kick the tires on what should become a new verification

I thought that a good design to check might be my
SDIO project.  It has roughly all the
pieces in place, and so makes sense for an automated testing pipeline.
This weekend, the CI project engineer shared with me:
It’s literally the first time I get to know a good hardware project needs
such many verifications and testings!  There’s even a real SD card
simulation model and RW test…
After reminiscing about this for a bit, I thought it might be worth taking a
moment to tell how I got here.

There are ongoing efforts to put more rigor around supply chain security, to begin as an industry to answer the average 742% increase in software supply chain attacks over the last 3 years.

service would be worthy of an article
even if it wasn't so contentious; tag2upload promises a
streamlined way for Debian developers using Git to upload packages to
the Debian
Archive. But tag2upload has been in limbo for
years due to disagreement and a communication breakdown between the team
behind tag2upload and the ftpmasters team. It took the
threat of a General
Resolution (GR), weeks of discussion, and more than
1,000 emails to finally move forward.]]></summary>

project, which produces operating system images based on Fedora's Atomic Desktops,
has issued an announcement
that manual steps are required to continue receiving updates. Jorge
Castro wrote:
If you use Bazzite, Bluefin, Aurora, or any other Universal Blue
image (including our toolboxes) then you need to follow the
instructions in this announcement in order to ensure that your device
is getting updates. We were rotating our cosign keypairs this morning,
which is the method that we use to sign our images.
During this process I made a critical error which has resulted in
forcing you to take manual steps to migrate to our newly signed
images.
This applies to all Universal Blue images released before July 2,
2024. See the full announcement for instructions. LWN covered Bluefin in

Not so long ago, email and SMS messages started to replace phone conversations, and soon after, instant messaging platforms gained popularity over the tools that came before it. Today, there is a big landscape of messaging platforms, and often people feel divided on which one to use to communicate with friends and family.
In the professional field, organizations usually mandate one common communication platform, but often more than one survives, fragmenting work discussions between them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I introduced two new tools to w64devkit, vc++filt and
peports (pronounced like purports), which aid manual symbol
inspection and complement one another. As of this writing, the latter is
not yet in a release, but it’s feature-complete and trivial to build if
you wanted to try it out early. This article explains the motivation and
purpose for each.
vc++filt
Binutils has c++filt, a tool to demangle C++ symbols. Its primary use

doesn’t look like a mangled C++ symbol, and interpolating human-friendly
names in place of mangled symbols. In, say, Vim I could run the current
buffer through it to translate mangled symbols (:%!c++filt).
Otherwise it’s often composed with other tools in a pipeline.

a
set of reports from the May
2024 FreeBSD Developer Summit held in Ottawa, Canada. The topics
include FreeBSD Core Team updates, FreeBSD 15 release planning,
Integration with Rust, and OCI
containers on FreeBSD:


Doug Rabson began by providing an overview of the current state of
FreeBSD support for OCI containers, noting that while FreeBSD has long
supported containers through its jail and vnet features, the ecosystem
around OCI containers requires further development. "FreeBSD has been
able to do containers for a long time, but we need to align better
with OCI standards to make our containers more compatible and easier
to use," Rabson remarked​​.]]></summary>

We strongly encourage maintainers of third-party Python projects to test with 3.13 during the beta phase and report issues found to the Python bug tracker

a summary of "papercut fixes" for GNOME tablet support that are
planned to ship with GNOME 47.
If you're an avid tablet user, you may have multiple stylus tools -
but it's also likely that you have multiple tools of the same type
which makes differentiating them in the GUI hard. Which is why they're
highlighted now - if you bring the tool into proximity, the matching
image is highlighted to make it easier to know which stylus you're
about to configure. Oh, and in the process we added a new SVG for AES
styli too to make the picture look more like the actual physical
tool. The <blink> tag may no longer be cool but at least we can disco
our way through the stylus configuration now.]]></summary>

areas to an image, while Overlay allows adding new content by
overlaying pixels from the current image or another image. LWN last

you want to boot your containers?" This isn't the setup for some technology joke, this is part of the trio's
keynote at
DevConf.cz in Brno, Czech Republic on June 14 about bootable containers
(bootc). The talk, which was streamed to YouTube for those of us who
didn't attend DevConf.cz in person, provided a solid overview of bootc
and the problems it is intended to solve. The idea behind bootc is to
make creating operating-system images just as easy as creating
application-container images while using the same tools.]]></summary>

Its use in Kubernetes-based applications has grown rapidly due to the revolutionary capabilities it enables, as demonstrated by Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) projects such as Cilium, Datadog, Calico, and Pixie.

	In a particular situation, when each scheduling policy needs its

	kernel scheduler needs to select a task to be scheduled, it calls
	the sched_class.pick_next_task(rq) callback of a concrete
	scheduling policy. When a task becomes runnable, the core kernel
	scheduler calls sched_class.enqueue(rq, p, flags) so the

a lot of the Xilinx IP I’ve come across, is to hold the video pipeline in
reset until everything is ready and then release the resets (in the right and
proper order) to get the design started.  If something goes wrong, however,
there’s no room for recovery.  The second approach is the approach I like to
use, which is to build video components that are inherently
“stable”: 1) if they
ever lose synchronization, they will naturally work their way back into
synchronization, and 2) once synchronized they will not get out of sync.
At least that’s the goal.  It’s a great goal, too–when it works.
Today’s story is about what happens when a “robust” video display isn’t.

Not only does it scan your image at upload time, it also provides an up-to-date view of your vulnerabilities, no matter how long ago you pushed it. There is no need to ask Quay.io to rescan your image—that information is available whenever you request it.
