disagreements that led to Eelco Dolstra

stepping down from the NixOS

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Doug Brown documents
the long journey to fixing a bug in the GDebi utility for
installing Debian packages. He first encountered the bug in
Ubuntu MATE 18.04: "at the time I just ignored this
issue. I didn't want to deal with it. I went off to the trusty Linux
terminal and installed Chrome that way instead".
Two and a half years ago, I committed to doing more open-source
contributions in my free time and was finally irritated enough about
this problem to look into it. I searched around for more info. Lo and
behold, lots
of people
were also
affected and there was already an
issue from 2019 on Ubuntu's bug tracker about it.
[...] As is commonly the case in software development, the difficult part of
this fix had nothing to do with the code itself. All of my effort was
spent figuring out Ubuntu's patch submission processes and advocating
for my merge request. Nobody else seemed to be interested in doing the
work to actually fix this bug that has been plaguing Ubuntu MATE and
Xubuntu, not to mention some Debian users, for over 6 years. After
dealing with the long process of getting my merge request approved, I
think I'm starting to understand why!


Brown notes that the fix is
now packaged for the upcoming Ubuntu 24.10 release, and should be
backported to 22.04 and 24.04 eventually.]]></summary>

and Fedora IoT systems installed
before Fedora 40 may fail to boot after an update if secure boot
is enabled. Fedora Magazine has a
post by Timothée Ravier about the problem, how users can work
around it, and what the project is doing to avoid the similar problems
in the future:
On Fedora Atomic Desktops and Fedora IoT systems, the components
that are part of the boot chain (Shim, GRUB) are not (yet)
automatically updated alongside the rest of the system. Thus, if you
have installed a Fedora Atomic Desktop or a Fedora IoT system before
Fedora 40, it uses an old versions of the Shim and bootloader binaries
to boot your system.
When Secure Boot is enabled, the EFI firmware loads Shim
first. Shim is signed by the Microsoft Third Party Certificate
Authority so that it can be verified on most hardware out of the
box. The Shim binary includes the Fedora certificates used to verify
binaries signed by Fedora. Then Shim loads GRUB, which in turn loads
the Linux kernel. Both are signed by Fedora.
Until recently, the kernel binaries where signed two times, with an
older key and a newer one. With the 6.9 kernel update, the kernel is
no longer signed with the old key. If GRUB or Shim is old enough and
does not know about the new key, the signature verification fails.]]></summary>

This is a great step forward as we continue to work on our mission to provide Observability as one. After releasing a Metrics UI and Logs UI, we enhance the overall Observability journey for our OpenShift users by providing the opportunity to visualize the third pillar of Observability: distributed tracing. This is a Developer Preview feature, as additional enhancements are currently being worked on.

Observability signal correlation for Red Hat OpenShift continues to be powered by Korrel8r—an open source observability project founded within Red Hat—aimed at providing a set of rules for easily correlating metrics, logs, alerts, and additional observability signals across different data stores. Key enhancements include 1) expanded signal support, as you can now correlate netflows, 2) brand new troubleshooting panel in the OpenShift web console that simplifies the overall observability si…]]></summary>

PSP security protocol (PSP) is a way to transparently encrypt packets by
efficiently offloading encryption and decryption to the network
interface cards (NICs) that Google uses for connections inside its data centers. The
protocol is similar to

IPsec, in that it allows for wrapping arbitrary traffic
in a layer of encryption. The difference is that PSP is encapsulated in UDP, and
designed from the beginning to reduce the amount of state that NICs
have to track in order to send and receive encrypted traffic, allowing for more
simultaneous connections. Jakub Kicinski

vulnerability that can be exploited for remote code execution, but only
on distributions that have applied a patch to add auditing support.
Specifically, RHEL 9 and derivatives are affected, as are
Fedora 36 and 37 (but not later releases).


	The main difference from CVE-2024-6387 is that the race condition
	and RCE potential are triggered in the privsep child process, which
	runs with reduced privileges compared to the parent server process.
	So immediate impact is lower.  However, there may be differences in
	exploitability of these vulnerabilities in a particular scenario,
	which could make either one of these a more attractive choice for
	an attacker, and if only one of these is fixed or mitigated then
	the other becomes more relevant.]]></summary>

In broad strokes, OpenType added support for color fonts, variable fonts, and the Universal Shaping Engine. The Free & Open Source stack supports all of these advances at the lower level, but application UI support has been slower to arrive. The Open Source text stack also gained enormous market-share when Android and Google Chrome fully embraced it.

Looking forward, there is a Rust migration of the text stack underway, which will unify font compilation and consumption under a safe programming language. Incremental Font Transfer will enable streaming fonts to web browsers. And my proposed Wasm-fonts will enable more expressive fonts.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At DevConf.cz 2024,
Marta Lewandowska gave a talk to discuss a
new approach for booting Linux systems, "No more boot
loader: Please use the kernel instead". The talk, available on
YouTube, introduced a new project called nmbl (for "no more bootloader",
pronounced "nimble"). The idea is to get rid of bootloaders (e.g., 
GNU GRUB) with a
Unified
Kernel Image (UKI) that removes the need for a separate bootloader
altogether. It is early days for nmbl, currently the project is only
being tested for use with virtual machines, but the idea is
compelling. If successful, nmbl could offer security, performance, and
maintenance benefits compared to GRUB and other separate bootloaders.]]></summary>

Now you can seamlessly leverage your corporate identity tokens to access the Red Hat OpenShift and Kubernetes APIs on ROSA with hosted control planes (HCP).
Benefits you'll experience:

Simplified authentication: No need to manage separate credentials for ROSA. Just use your familiar corporate identity, making access easier and more secure.
Unified access control: Bring your existing user and group management policies into ROSA. Manage permissions consistently across your organization with a single, unified approach.

to shake the screws and kick the tires on what should become a new verification
product shortly.
I thought that a good design to check might be my
SDIO project.  It has roughly all the
pieces in place, and so makes sense for an automated testing pipeline.
This weekend, the CI project engineer shared with me:
It’s literally the first time I get to know a good hardware project needs
such many verifications and testings!  There’s even a real SD card
simulation model and RW test…
After reminiscing about this for a bit, I thought it might be worth taking a
moment to tell how I got here.

Answering these questions becomes increasingly complex as the number of permutations of use rises. There are ongoing efforts to put more rigor around supply chain security, to begin as an industry to answer the average 742% increase in software supply chain attacks over the last 3 years. 
One important aspect of software supply chain security is achieving reproducible builds of dependent software. Reproducible builds are achieved by a set of software development practices that create an independently verifiab…]]></summary>

back at 40 years of the X Window System:


	A major reason for Sun's early success was that they in effect
	open-sourced the Network File System. X11 was open source under the
	MIT license. I, and some of the other Sun engineers, understood
	that NeWS could not displace X11 as the Unix standard window system
	without being equally open source. But Sun's management looked at
	NeWS and saw superior technology, an extension of the PostScript

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the internet evolves and technologies and trends emerge, so do the ways people and organizations connect. Not only is digitalization transforming and automating processes, but social changes and events are also making an impact that shapes how we interact.
Not so long ago, email and SMS messages started to replace phone conversations, and soon after, instant messaging platforms gained popularity over the tools that came before it. Today, there is a big landscape of messaging platforms, and often people feel divided on which one to use to communicate with friends and family.
In the professional field, organizations usually mandate one common communication platform, but often more than one survives, fragmenting work discussions between them.

inspection and complement one another. As of this writing, the latter is

you wanted to try it out early. This article explains the motivation and
purpose for each.
vc++filt
Binutils has c++filt, a tool to demangle C++ symbols. Its primary use
case is operating on whole files or streams, passing through anything that
doesn’t look like a mangled C++ symbol, and interpolating human-friendly
names in place of mangled symbols. In, say, Vim I could run the current
buffer through it to translate mangled symbols (:%!c++filt).
Otherwise it’s often composed with other tools in a pipeline.

Apple's unfair behaviour against Free Software highlights the critical need to
monitor the implementation of the DMA. The FSFE collaborated with F-Droid, the
AppFair project, and other interoperability experts to scrutinize Apple's DMA
compliance, and it's impact on Free Software. Since then, we coordinated several

a
set of reports from the May
2024 FreeBSD Developer Summit held in Ottawa, Canada. The topics
include FreeBSD Core Team updates, FreeBSD 15 release planning,
Integration with Rust, and OCI
containers on FreeBSD:


Doug Rabson began by providing an overview of the current state of
FreeBSD support for OCI containers, noting that while FreeBSD has long
supported containers through its jail and vnet features, the ecosystem
around OCI containers requires further development. "FreeBSD has been
able to do containers for a long time, but we need to align better
with OCI standards to make our containers more compatible and easier
to use," Rabson remarked​​.]]></summary>

We strongly encourage maintainers of third-party Python projects to test with 3.13 during the beta phase and report issues found to the Python bug tracker

a summary of "papercut fixes" for GNOME tablet support that are
planned to ship with GNOME 47.
If you're an avid tablet user, you may have multiple stylus tools -
but it's also likely that you have multiple tools of the same type
which makes differentiating them in the GUI hard. Which is why they're
highlighted now - if you bring the tool into proximity, the matching
image is highlighted to make it easier to know which stylus you're
about to configure. Oh, and in the process we added a new SVG for AES
styli too to make the picture look more like the actual physical
tool. The <blink> tag may no longer be cool but at least we can disco
our way through the stylus configuration now.]]></summary>

the
2024 Linux Storage,

conversion of the existing kernel filesystems to use the mount API that was added for the 5.2 kernel in 2019.  That API is

Its use in Kubernetes-based applications has grown rapidly due to the revolutionary capabilities it enables, as demonstrated by Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) projects such as Cilium, Datadog, Calico, and Pixie. However, eBPF in Kubernetes also poses a number of new challenges for developers and administrators alike. These challenges include program lifecycle management issues, the widespread use of privileged pods, the lack of eBPF subsystem visibility, and problems with program cooperation.

introduction to writing custom schedulers with sched_ext.


	In a particular situation, when each scheduling policy needs its
	specific action, the core kernel scheduler calls an operation
	defined in struct sched_class. For example, when the core
	kernel scheduler needs to select a task to be scheduled, it calls
	the sched_class.pick_next_task(rq) callback of a concrete
	scheduling policy. When a task becomes runnable, the core kernel
	scheduler calls sched_class.enqueue(rq, p, flags) so the
	concrete scheduling policy enqueues task p to run queue
	rq. When a task's runtime state needs to be updated, the
	core kernel scheduler calls sched_class.update_curr(rq).]]></summary>

a lot of the Xilinx IP I’ve come across, is to hold the video pipeline in
reset until everything is ready and then release the resets (in the right and
proper order) to get the design started.  If something goes wrong, however,
there’s no room for recovery.  The second approach is the approach I like to
use, which is to build video components that are inherently
“stable”: 1) if they
ever lose synchronization, they will naturally work their way back into
synchronization, and 2) once synchronized they will not get out of sync.
At least that’s the goal.  It’s a great goal, too–when it works.

	Android. In that respect, Tor Browser 13.5 feels like a milestone:
	in addition to the dozens of bug fixes and minor improvements noted
	in the changelog below, this release features major changes to
	Android's connection experience in preparation for the future
	addition of Connection Assist, including full access to Settings
	before connecting and a new, permanent home for Tor logs.


The release also features desktop user-interface improvements and enhanced

Not only does it scan your image at upload time, it also provides an up-to-date view of your vulnerabilities, no matter how long ago you pushed it. There is no need to ask Quay.io to rescan your image—that information is available whenever you request it.

What does the underlying platform environment look like in terms of architecture/topology/design?
What underlying storage is available and how is that presented?
Replication options.

LLD provides production-quality support for the following architectures:

MIPS
PowerPC and PowerPC64
RISC-V

Despite this list, there is still one architecture supported by Fedora that was missing: s390x. This absence impacts how Fedora packages are built on s390x, either by prohibiting packages that require LLD or by requiring that the s390x package is linked with a different linker than other architectures. This difference is known to increase the maintenance burden because different linkers can behave differently.
The support for s390x was added to LLD 18.1. In this article, we explore the work involved…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The kernel has a lot of code paths that are normally disabled: debugging print
statements, tracepoints, etc. To support these efficiently, there
is a common mechanism called

static keys that provides a way to enable or disable a
code path at run time, with effectively no overhead for disabled
branches. BPF programs have not been able to take advantage of static keys so far,
because they aren't compiled into the kernel.
Now, it looks like BPF may be getting support for a similar mechanism —
and the design could also provide one of the components needed to support

jump tables, another missing feature.
Anton Protopovov presented his plans to add static keys to BPF at the 2024
Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Software-interrupt handlers (also called "bottom halves") have a long
history in the Linux kernel; for much of that history, developers have
wished that they could go away.  One of their unfortunate characteristics
is that they can add unexpected latency to the execution of unrelated
processes; this problem is felt especially acutely in the
realtime-preemption community.  The solution adopted there has created
problems of its own, though; in response Sebastian Andrzej Siewior is proposing
a new locking mechanism for realtime builds of the kernel that may have
benefits for non-realtime users as well.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this blog post, we’ll examine the potentially simple task of getting and displaying file time. Usually, we can depend on some library or OS-specific code to get that file property. Fortunately, since C++20, we have a reliable and simple technique from the std::filesystem and std::chrono components.
Let’s jump in.



     
    


In C++, working with files was usually reserved for OS APIs and third-party libraries. Here are two examples of such an approach:



     
    


In Linux or any POSIX-compliant system, you can use the stat function to get file times.
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <ctime>

int main() {
    const char* file_path = "example.txt";

One thing I find interesting about discussions of bias is how different the reaction is in the LLM and generative AI case when compared to "classical" bugs in cases where there's a clear bug. In particular, if you look at forums or other discussions with lay people, people frequently deny that a model which produces output that's sort of the opposite of what the user asked for is even a bug.

This is a bit different than what we for instance are doing in RHEL, where we are working with NVIDIA to provide pre-signed kernel modules, but that is a lot harder to do in Fedora due to the rapidly updating kernel versions and which most Fedora users appreciate as a big plus. So instead what we are for opting in Fedora is as I said to make it simple for you to self-sign the kernel module for use with secure boot. We are currently looking at when we can make this feature available, but no later than Fedora Workstation 41 for sure.]]></summary>

Placing functions that reference each other frequently in the same area of memory can help reduce the need to load and unload pages of memory. Similarly, pieces of data that are used a lot at the same time benefit from being located in the same region of memory.
Alternatively, sometimes it is better not to group code and data based upon its use, but rather upon its similarity to each other. Placing similar code and data in adjacent memory regions means that the binary image can be compressed to a greater degree, a feature which is often important for mobile applications.

Kimos is the name of one of the current open source

officially named the “Kintex-7 Memory controller, Open Source toolchain”, but
the team shortened that to “KiMOS” and I’ve gotten to the point where I just
call it “Kimos” (pronounced KEE-mos).  The goals of the project are twofold.
Test an Open Source DDR3 SDRAM memory
controller.
This includes both performance testing, and performance comparisons against
Xilinx’s MIG controller.
Just as a note, Angelo’s
controller has a couple of
differences with Xilinx’s controller.  One of them is a simpler
