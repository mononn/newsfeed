concept to the memory-management subsystem appears to be stalled, but appearances can

is a bit surprising, given that Linux has benefited greatly from the

kernels are seen versus how they are actually maintained.  He proposed
making a "rolling stable" release that 
provides users what they need—timely fixes to their kernel—without forcing

    router should I use?". 
It's not an easy question to answer, either. There are probably more than 100 different routers
        available, all with different APIs, features, and behaviors. So for this blog post I've evaluated 30 popular
        ones, and created a shortlist of the best options along with a flowchart that you can use to help guide your choice.
    
Note: If you don't want to read the discussion, you can skip to the flowchart.
    
Before we start, a few notes on terminology:
By supports method-based routing I mean that the router makes it easy to dispatch a HTTP

two competing compilers — GCC and LLVM — either of which can usually get

are legitimate reasons for developers to wish for an alternative.  As it
turns out, there are two different ways to compile Rust using GCC under

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paul McKenney has started a blog series on Rust for the Linux kernel.  He has posted six of a planned 11 articles, though several are labeled as "under construction".

This series focuses mostly on use cases and opportunities, rather than on any non-trivial solutions. Please note that I am not in any way attempting to dictate or limit Rust's level of ambition. I am instead noting the memory-model consequences of a few potential levels of ambition, ranging from "portions of a few drivers", "a few drivers", "some core code" and up to and including "the entire kernel". Greater levels of ambition will require greater willingness to accommodate a wider variety of LKMM [Linux-kernel memory model] requirements.

[...]
These blog posts will therefore present approaches ranging upwards from trivial workarounds. But be warned that some of the high-quality approaches require profound reworking of compiler backends that have thus far failed to spark joy in the hearts of compiler writers. In addition, Rust enjoys considerable use outside of the Linux kernel, for example, as something into which to rewrite inefficient Python scripts. (A megawatt here, a megawatt there, and pretty soon you are talking about real power consumption!) Therefore, there are probably sharp limits beyond which the core Rust developers are unwilling to go.]]></summary>

아이폰의 메모리를 덤프하고 프로세스 메모리를 분석하는 작업을 수행해보자.


frida 설치(Jailbreaken iOS Device)
탈옥한 아이폰에는 기본적으로 시디아(cydia)가 설치되어 있다. 일종의 앱스토어인데 그 안에서 frida를 검색하여 설치하자.
위의 설치는 탈옥한 아이폰에서 진행한 것이다. 그렇다면 이제 아이폰과 연결할 컴퓨터에서도 frida를 설치해야 연동할 수 있다.
나의 경우 macOS에서 아래의 명령어로 설치했다.
$ pip install --upgrade pip
$ pip install frida
$ pip install frida-tools
이제 mac과 iphone을 USB 방식으로 연결을 한다.
그리고 mac에서 다음의 명령어를 입력하면 현재 수행중인 프로세스 목록을 볼 수 있으며, pid 번호도 보인다.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Posted by Sarah Fullmer, Program Manager
     
The Flutter Meetup Network (FMN) is an international network of Meetup groups united by their enthusiasm for Flutter. The FMN program mission is to foster a thriving worldwide community of Flutter developers by empowering community organizers to educate and inspire local communities with engaging events.
Meetups – and similar developer community groups - are a great resource. As Flutter has grown in popularity over the past few years, over 100 Meetup groups have sprung up organically around the world to celebrate and educate their members about Flutter. The volunteers who run these groups have hosted many awesome events and workshops. 
    
We, in the Flutter team, see and appreciate these amazing communities. 💙 The Flutter Meetup Network (FMN) is now being launched to support these groups officially. Network members will have access to various resources (more details available soon!), making it easier to plan and host Flutter-themed events. 
Meetups have many benefits, aside from networking. When stuck on an issue in your current Flutter project, chances are good that you can find a developer in your local Flutter Meetup who has solved a similar problem. Or, maybe they know the perfect package for your needs. 
We are thrilled to support our amazing and passionate organizers and can’t wait to see what the Flutter Meetup Network does moving forward. 
Join a Meetup near you! https://www.meetup.com/pro/flutter]]></summary>

about the challenges that face developers trying to build the GNU C

	Is it worth it to fix glibc (and other projects which support only

	alternatives already supporting LLVM? Is it best to use both GCC
	and LLVM, each for their respective supported projects?

Today there are over 276 million smart home households globally, and the industry continues to see rapid growth every year. Users have never been more comfortable bringing home new smart home devices — but they also continue to expect more from their devices, and their smart homes. To meet and exceed these expectations,   we want to make sure developers have the tools and support to build their best experience across the Google Home app, Nest, Android, and Assistant.  
That’s why we’re excited to announce the return of the Google Smart Home Developer Summit on October 21, 2021! This year’s event is free to join, fully virtual and will be hosted on our website with broadcast times available for our developer communities in the AMER, EMEA, and APAC regions. 
To kick things off, Michele Turner, Senior Director of Product for Google’s Smart Home Ecosystem, will share our vision for the home and preview upcoming tools and features to build your next devices and apps using Matter and Thread — technologies transforming the industry. This will be followed by a developer keynote to dig deeper into announcements, and a round of technical sessions, workshops, and more, hosted by Google's smart home leaders. 
Building the best smart home platform means using trusted technology and intelligence to develop your integrations faster, provide tools to drive your innovation, and allow you new paths to growth. We can’t wait to engage with you and share more about how we can lead and grow the smart home together. 
You can register for the Google Smart Home Developer Summit 2021 here, and follow along with the event using the tag #GoogleHomeSummit on social media. We hope to see you there!]]></summary>

   Developers: it’s time to start marking your calendars, we’re hard at work on a busy slate of summits coming your way in just a few weeks. Here’s a quick rundown of three summits we just announced this week:  
 
Android Dev Summit: October 27-28  
Chrome Dev Summit: November 3  
Firebase Summit: November 10 

Android Dev Summit is back, October 27-28
Directly from the team who builds Android, the Android Dev Summit returns this year on October 27-28. Join us to hear about the latest updates in Android development, centered on this year’s theme: excellent apps, across devices. We have over 30 sessions on a range of technical Android development topics. Plus, we’ve assembled the team that builds Android to get your burning #AskAndroid questions answered live. Interested in learning more? Be sure to sign up for updates through our Android newsletter here. 
Discover, Connect, Inspire at Chrome Dev Summit 2021
The countdown to Chrome Dev Summit 2021 is on — and we can’t wait to share what we have in store. We’ll kick things off on November 3 by sharing the latest product updates in our keynote and hosting a live ask me anything (AMA) with Chrome leaders. You’ll also have the chance to chat live with Googlers and developers around the world, participate in workshops with industry experts, attend interactive learning lounges to consult with engineers in a group setting, and receive personalized support during one-on-one office hours. Everyone can tune into the keynote and AMA, but space is limited for the workshops, office hours, and learning lounges. Request an invite to secure your spot — we’ll see you on November 3! 
And follow the Firebase Twitter channel for more updates on Firebase Summit, which will be coming to you on November 10!]]></summary>

Introduction
 Since its original launch in 2008, many of the core Google App Engine services such as Datastore, Memcache, and Blobstore, have matured to become their own standalone products: for example, Cloud Datastore, Cloud Memorystore, and Cloud Storage, respectively. The same is true for App Engine Task Queues with Cloud Tasks. Today's Module 7 episode of Serverless Migration Station reviews how App Engine push tasks work, by adding this feature to an existing App Engine ndb Flask app.

If we look at trendy companies that are within a couple factors of two in size of Twitter (in terms of either market cap or number of engineers), they mostly don't have similar expertise, often as a result of path dependence — because they "grew up" in the cloud, they didn't need kernel expertise to keep the lights on the way an on prem company does. While that makes it socially understandable that people who've spent their career at younger, trendier, companies, are surprised by Twitter having a kernel team, I don't think there's a te…]]></summary>

Introduction

Google Cloud offers three distinct ways of running your code or application in a serverless way, each serving different use cases. Google App Engine, our first Cloud product, was created to give users the ability to deploy source-based web applications or mobile backends directly to the cloud without the need of thinking about servers or scaling. Cloud Functions came later for scenarios where you may not have an entire app, great for one-off utility functions or event-driven microservices. Cloud Run is our latest fully-managed serverless product that gives developers the flexibility of containers along with the convenience of serverless. 
As all are serverless compute platforms, users recognize they share so…]]></summary>

내가 컴퓨터공학 학부 2학년을 다니던 2009년 즈음, 전공 2학년 때 배우는 객체지향 프로그래밍 시간에는 C++을 배웠었다. 서점에 갔는데, C/C++ 및 자료구조의 '열혈 프로그래밍' 시리즈로 유명한 윤성우님이 JAVA 프로그래밍 책을 출간하셨다. 놀랍게도 제목은 [난 정말 JAVA를 공부한 적이 없다구요]였다(이 책은 현재 '열혈 Java 프로그래밍'으로 개정되어 출간되었다). 그 당시 잠시 책을 살펴보긴 했지만, C++과는 코딩 스타일이 너무 다르다는 생각에 우선은 배우기를 보류했던 기억이 난다. 그런데 내가 졸업하고 몇 년 뒤부터는 학부과정 수업이 JAVA로 바뀌었다는 소식을 전해 들었다. 결과적으로 나는 JAVA를 배운 적이 없었다.
학교를 졸업하고 군대에 가서 프로그래밍을 할 일이 많았는데, 물론 대다수의 공공기관은 전자정부 표준프레임워크 사용에 따라 JAVA를 사용할 일이 많았다. 하지만 난 여전히 C/C++을 선호하던 관성을 따르고 싶었기에 꼭 필요한 경우가 아니면 JAVA를 회피했다. 현재의 나는 주로 Python을 사용하고 golang도 배우고 있지만 이상하게도 아직까지 굳이 JAVA를 직접적으로 사용할 일은 극히 드문 상황이다. 어쩌면 내가 의도적으로 피했기 때문은 아닐까 하는 생각도 들었다. 다른 프로그래밍 언어를 알고 있으므로, 남이 작성한 자바 코드를 보고 어느 정도 읽고 이해하고 약간 수정할 줄은 알지만, 굳이 JAVA를 사용하여 프로그램을 만들고 싶은 적은 없었던 것이다.

lengthy missive from Lennart Poettering taking Linux distributors to
task for inadequately protecting systems from physical attacks.


	So, does the scheme so far implemented by generic Linux
	distributions protect us against the latter two scenarios?
	Unfortunately not at all. Because distributions set up disk
	encryption the way they do, and only bind it to a user password, an
	attacker can easily duplicate the disk, and then attempt to brute
	force your password. What's worse: since code authentication ends
	at the kernel — and the initrd is not authenticated anymore —,
	backdooring is trivially easy: an attacker can change the initrd
	any way they want, without having to fight any kind of protections.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over at the Guix-HPC blog, Ludovic Courtès writes about trying to package the PyTorch machine-learning library for the Guix distribution.  Building from source in a user-verifiable manner is part of the philosophy behind Guix, but there were a number of problems that were encountered:

The first surprise when starting packaging PyTorch is that, despite being on PyPI, PyTorch is first and foremost a large C++ code base. It does have a setup.py as commonly found in pure Python packages, but that file delegates the bulk of the work to CMake.

The second surprise is that PyTorch bundles (or "vendors", as some would say) source code for no less than 41 dependencies, ranging from small Python and C++ helper libraries to large C++ neural network tools. Like other distributions such as Debian, Guix avoids bundling: we would rather have one Guix package for each of these dependencies. The rationale is manifold, but it boils down to keeping things auditable, reducing resource usage, and making security updates practical.]]></summary>

Yara Elkady, Google Developer Student Club (GDSC) Lead, can trace her passion for tech all the way back to a single moment. She was sitting in computer class when her middle school teacher posed a question to the class: 

“Did you know that you can create apps and games like the ones that you spend so much time on?”

It was a simple question, but it was enough to plant the seed that would define the trajectory of Yara’s career. Following in the footsteps of so many beginners before her, Yara did a Google search to find out more about creating apps.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Middleboxes are,
unfortunately in many ways, a big part of today's internet.  While middleboxes
inhabit the same physical niche as routers, they are not aimed at packet forwarding;
instead they are meant to monitor and manipulate the packets that they
see.  The effects of those devices on users of the networks they reign over may be
unfortunate as well, but the rest of the internet is only affected when
trying to communicate with those users—or so it was thought.  Based on some
recently reported research, it turns out that middleboxes can be abused to 
inflict denial-of-service (DoS) attacks elsewhere on the net.]]></summary>

 Long gone are the days of looking for documentation, finding a how-to guide, and questioning whether the commands and code samples actually work. 
Google Cloud recently added a Cloud Shell integration within each and every documentation page. 
This new functionality lets you test code in a preprovisioned virtual machine instance while learning about Google Cloud services. Running commands and code from the documentation cuts down on context switching between the documentation and a terminal window to run the commands in a tutorial. 
This gif shows how Google Cloud’s documentation uses Cloud Shell, letting you run commands in a quickstart within your Cloud Shell environment.

overview of the Python 3.10 pattern-matching feature.


	As shown above, there are cases where match really

	syntax trees and writing parsers. A lot of code does have
	if ... elif chains, but these are often either
	plain switch-on-value, where elif works almost as well, or
	the conditions they’re testing are a more complex combination of
	tests that don’t fit into case patterns (unless you use awkward

 Google Developers Experts is a global community of developers, engineers and thought leaders who passionately share their technical knowledge with others.  
Becoming a Google Developers Expert is no easy task. First, you need to have strong skills in one of the technical areas - Android, Kotlin, Google Cloud, Machine Learning, Web Technologies, Angular, Firebase, Google Workspace, Flutter or other. You also need to have a track record of sharing your knowledge - be it via conference talks, your personal blog, youtube videos or in some other form. Finally, you need one more thing. The courage to approach an existing Expert or a Google employee and ask them to support your application.

work on tracking where the build failures due to -Werror come from.

Is it done? No. But on the whole I'm feeling fairly good about this
all, even if it has meant that I've been looking at some really odd

on alpha, after all these years? A slight change of pace ;)]]></summary>

	that NVidia is the market leader, especially in the professional

at the difficulties caused by the OpenSSL 3 transition in the
context of Alpine Linux.


	For distributions, however, the story is different:
	cryptography moved to using Rust, because they wanted to
	leverage all of the static analysis capabilities built into the
	language.  This, too, is a reasonable decision, from a development
	perspective.  From the ecosystem perspective, however, it is
	problematic, as the Rust ecosystem is still rapidly evolving, and
	so we cannot support a single branch of the Rust compiler for an
	entire 2 year lifecycle, which means it exists in community.  Our
	solution, historically, has been to hold cryptography at
	the latest version that did not require Rust to build.  However,
	that version is not compatible with OpenSSL 3, and so it will
	eventually need to be upgraded to a new version which is.  And so,
	since cryptography has to move to community, so does

ars technica article describes a problem with the Travis
continuous-integration service:


	A security flaw in Travis CI potentially exposed the secrets of
	thousands of open source projects that rely on the hosted
	continuous integration service. Travis CI is a software-testing
	solution used by over 900,000 open source projects and 600,000

There seems to be a lot of confusion around the implementation of C++20 coroutines, which I think is due to the draft technical specification for C++20 stating that coroutines are a work in progress so we can’t expect full compiler and library support at this point in time.
A lot of the problems probably arise from the lack of official documentation about working with coroutines. We have been given C++ syntax support for coroutines (the co_yield and co_return) but without [...]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This article was discussed on Hacker News.
Years ago, OpenBSD gained two new security system calls, pledge(2)
(originally tame(2)) and unveil. In both, an application
surrenders capabilities at run-time. The idea is to perform initialization
like usual, then drop capabilities before handling untrusted input,
limiting unwanted side effects. This feature is applicable even where type
safety isn’t an issue, such as Python, where a program might still get
tricked into accessing sensitive files or making network connections when
it shouldn’t. So how can a Python program access these system calls?
As discussed previously, it’s quite easy to access C APIs from
Python through its ctypes package, and this is no exception.
In this article I show how to do it. Here’s the full source if you want to

is a flexible tool for managing issues via the web or
email. However, Roundup is useful for more than
web-based bug tracking or help-desk ticketing; it can be used as a simple 
wiki or to manage tasks
with the Getting Things
Done (GTD) 
methodology. The 20th-anniversary
edition of
Roundup,
version 2.1.0, was
released in July; it is a maintenance release, but there have been a number
of larger improvements in the last year or so. Here we introduce 
Roundup's

recent developments that have helped make Roundup even more useful for tracking
issues to their resolution.]]></summary>

coincidence I happened to be thinking about code names myself while
recently replaying XCOM: Enemy Within (2012/2013). The game
generates a random code name for each mission, and I wondered how often it
repeats. The UFOpaedia page on the topic gives the word lists: 53
adjectives and 76 nouns, for a total of 4028 possible code names. A
typical game has around 60 missions, and if code names are generated
naively on the fly, then per the birthday paradox around half of all games
will see a repeated mission code name! Fortunately this is easy to avoid,
and the particular configuration here lends itself to an interesting
implementation.
Mission code names are built using “adjective noun”. Some examples

How the idea emerged
With the advancement of technology, drones have become not only smaller, but also have more compute. There are many examples of iPhone-sized quadcopters in the consumer drone market and the computing power to do live tracking while recording 4K video. However, the most important element has not changed much - the controller. It is still bulky and not intuitive for beginners to use. There is a smartphone with on-display control as an option; however, the control principle is still the same.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Linux Foundation has announced that  Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX) has become an international standard (ISO/IEC 5962:2021).  SPDX has been used in the kernel and other projects to identify the licenses and attach other metadata to  software components.

Between eighty and ninety percent (80%-90%) of a modern application is assembled from open source software components. An SBOM [software bill of materials] accounts for the software components contained in an application — open source, proprietary, or third-party — and details their provenance, license, and security attributes. SBOMs are used as a part of a foundational practice to track and trace components across software supply chains. SBOMs also help to proactively identify software issues and risks and establish a starting point for their remediation.

SPDX results from ten years of collaboration from representatives across industries, including the leading Software Composition Analysis (SCA) vendors – making it the most robust, mature, and adopted SBOM standard.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When we last caught up with the page folio patch set, it appeared to be on
track to be pulled into the mainline during the 5.15 merge window.  Matthew
Wilcox duly sent a pull
request in August to make that happen.  While it is possible that
folios could still end up in 5.15, that has not happened as of this writing
and appears increasingly unlikely.  What we got instead was a lengthy
discussion on the merits of the folio approach.]]></summary>
