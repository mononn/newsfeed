Summary
  
Google Identity strives to be the best stewards for Google Account users who entrust us to protect their data. At the same time, we want to help our developer community build apps that give users amazing experiences. Together, Google and developers can provide users three important ways to manage sharing their data: 
 
Give users control in deciding who has access to their account data  
Make it easier and safer for users to share their Google Account data with your app when they choose to do so  
Make it clear to users the specific data they are sharing with apps


What we are doing today

In service of that stewardship, today we are announcing an OAuth consent experience that simplifies how users…]]></summary>

Let’s review some common concerns so that we don’t shoot yourself in the foot :)
Some predefines
Let us take a simple Test class with one member field to present further concepts:
struct Test {
   Test() { std::cout << "Test::Test\n"; }
   ~Test() { std::cout << "Test::~Test destructor\n"; }

   int val_ { 0 };
};


With the above declaration, we’ll be able to see when it was constructed and destructed.
If we need some more advanced reporting, including move semantics, we could also implement move and copy constructors and assignment operators, but it will be good for now. See more in: Moved or Not Moved - That Is the Question! - C++ Sto…]]></summary>

From the sans-serif fonts to the muted pastel color palette, the stark white backgrounds to the curvy shape and hue of the buttons, most modern software blurs together into a familiar, squint-and-you’ll-confuse-it aesthetic.  Historically, the look...

concept to the memory-management subsystem appears to be stalled, but appearances can
be deceiving.  The numerous folio discussions have produced a number of
points of consensus, though; one of those is that far too much of the
kernel has to work with page structures to get its job done.  As
an example of how a subsystem might be weaned off of struct page
usage, Matthew Wilcox has split out
the slab allocators in a 62-part patch set.  The result may be
a foreshadowing of changes to come in the memory-management subsystem.]]></summary>

window is the ksmbd
network filesystem server.  Ksmbd implements the SMB protocol
(also known as CIFS, though that name has gone out of favor) that is
heavily used in the Windows world.  The creation of an in-kernel SMB server
is a bit surprising, given that Linux has benefited greatly from the
user-space Samba solution since
shortly after the
beginning.  There are reasons for this move but, in the short term at
least, they risk being overshadowed by a worrisome stream of

    router should I use?". 
It's not an easy question to answer, either. There are probably more than 100 different routers
        available, all with different APIs, features, and behaviors. So for this blog post I've evaluated 30 popular
        ones, and created a shortlist of the best options along with a flowchart that you can use to help guide your choice.
    
Note: If you don't want to read the discussion, you can skip to the flowchart.
    
Before we start, a few notes on terminology:
By supports method-based routing I mean that the router makes it easy to dispatch a HTTP
        request to different handlers based on the request method ("GET",

two competing compilers — GCC and LLVM — either of which can usually get

are legitimate reasons for developers to wish for an alternative.  As it
turns out, there are two different ways to compile Rust using GCC under

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paul McKenney has started a blog series on Rust for the Linux kernel.  He has posted six of a planned 11 articles, though several are labeled as "under construction".

This series focuses mostly on use cases and opportunities, rather than on any non-trivial solutions. Please note that I am not in any way attempting to dictate or limit Rust's level of ambition. I am instead noting the memory-model consequences of a few potential levels of ambition, ranging from "portions of a few drivers", "a few drivers", "some core code" and up to and including "the entire kernel". Greater levels of ambition will require greater willingness to accommodate a wider variety of LKMM [Linux-kernel memory model] requirements.

[...]
These blog posts will therefore present approaches ranging upwards from trivial workarounds. But be warned that some of the high-quality approaches require profound reworking of compiler backends that have thus far failed to spark joy in the hearts of compiler writers. In addition, Rust enjoys considerable use outside of the Linux kernel, for example, as something into which to rewrite inefficient Python scripts. (A megawatt here, a megawatt there, and pretty soon you are talking about real power consumption!) Therefore, there are probably sharp limits beyond which the core Rust developers are unwilling to go.]]></summary>

The Flutter Meetup Network (FMN) is an international network of Meetup groups united by their enthusiasm for Flutter. The FMN program mission is to foster a thriving worldwide community of Flutter developers by empowering community organizers to educate and inspire local communities with engaging events.
Meetups – and similar developer community groups - are a great resource. As Flutter has grown in popularity over the past few years, over 100 Meetup groups have sprung up organically around the world to celebrate and educate their members about Flutter. The volunteers who run these groups have hosted many awesome events and workshops. 
    
We, in the Flutter team, see and appreciate these amazing communities. 💙 The Flutter Meetup Network (FMN) is now being launched to support these groups officially. Network members will have access to various resources (more details available soon!), making it easier to plan and host Flutter-themed events. 
Meetups have many benefits, aside from networking. When stuck on an issue in your current Flutter project, chances are good that you can find a developer in your local Flutter Meetup who has solved a similar problem. Or, maybe they know the perfect package for your needs. 
We are thrilled to support our amazing and passionate organizers and can’t wait to see what the Flutter Meetup Network does moving forward. 
Join a Meetup near you! https://www.meetup.com/pro/flutter]]></summary>

GitHub, GitLab, or sourcehut) with enthusiasm.  The kernel community has
not.  Reasons for that reticence vary, but one that is often heard is that
these forges simply don't work well at the scale needed for the kernel
project.  At a
Kernel-Summit session during the 2021 
Linux Plumbers conference, Donald Zickus and Prarit Bhargava sought to
show how Red Hat has put GitLab to good use to support its kernel team.

about the challenges that face developers trying to build the GNU C

	Is it worth it to fix glibc (and other projects which support only
	GCC) to build with LLVM? Is it better to just replace them with
	alternatives already supporting LLVM? Is it best to use both GCC
	and LLVM, each for their respective supported projects?

	This post is an exploration starting from these questions but does

Users have never been more comfortable bringing home new smart home devices — but they also continue to expect more from their devices, and their smart homes. To meet and exceed these expectations,   we want to make sure developers have the tools and support to build their best experience across the Google Home app, Nest, Android, and Assistant.  
That’s why we’re excited to announce the return of the Google Smart Home Developer Summit on October 21, 2021! This year’s event is free to join, fully virtual and will be hosted on our website with broadcast times available for our developer communities in the AMER, EMEA, and APAC regions. 
To kick things off, Michele Turner, Senior Director of Product for Google’s Smart Home Ecosystem, will share our vision for the home and preview upcoming tools and features to build your next devices and apps using Matter and Thread — technologies transforming the industry. This will be followed by a developer keynote to dig deeper into announcements, and a round of technical sessions, workshops, and more, hosted by Google's smart home leaders. 
Building the best smart home platform means using trusted technology and intelligence to develop your integrations faster, provide tools to drive your innovation, and allow you new paths to growth. We can’t wait to engage with you and share more about how we can lead and grow the smart home together. 
You can register for the Google Smart Home Developer Summit 2021 here, and follow along with the event using the tag #GoogleHomeSummit on social media. We hope to see you there!]]></summary>

   Developers: it’s time to start marking your calendars, we’re hard at work on a busy slate of summits coming your way in just a few weeks. Here’s a quick rundown of three summits we just announced this week:  
 
Android Dev Summit: October 27-28  
Chrome Dev Summit: November 3  
Firebase Summit: November 10 

Android Dev Summit is back, October 27-28
Directly from the team who builds Android, the Android Dev Summit returns this year on October 27-28. Join us to hear about the latest updates in Android development, centered on this year’s theme: excellent apps, across devices. We have over 30 sessions on a range of technical Android development topics. Plus, we’ve assembled the team that builds Android to get your burning #AskAndroid questions answered live. Interested in learning more? Be sure to sign up for updates through our Android newsletter here. 
Discover, Connect, Inspire at Chrome Dev Summit 2021
The countdown to Chrome Dev Summit 2021 is on — and we can’t wait to share what we have in store. We’ll kick things off on November 3 by sharing the latest product updates in our keynote and hosting a live ask me anything (AMA) with Chrome leaders. You’ll also have the chance to chat live with Googlers and developers around the world, participate in workshops with industry experts, attend interactive learning lounges to consult with engineers in a group setting, and receive personalized support during one-on-one office hours. Everyone can tune into the keynote and AMA, but space is limited for the workshops, office hours, and learning lounges. Request an invite to secure your spot — we’ll see you on November 3! 
And follow the Firebase Twitter channel for more updates on Firebase Summit, which will be coming to you on November 10!]]></summary>

Introduction
 Since its original launch in 2008, many of the core Google App Engine services such as Datastore, Memcache, and Blobstore, have matured to become their own standalone products: for example, Cloud Datastore, Cloud Memorystore, and Cloud Storage, respectively. The same is true for App Engine Task Queues with Cloud Tasks. Today's Module 7 episode of Serverless Migration Station reviews how App Engine push tasks work, by adding this feature to an existing App Engine ndb Flask app.

competition "Youth Hacking 4 Freedom" (YH4F) for European teenagers
(14-18).  Six winners will receive a cash prize and a trip to Brussels.
There will be an opening event October 10 and registration will remain open
until October 31.

On Monday 1 November 2021, a five-month coding phase starts and the participants focus on coding until March 2022. Participants may bring all their imagination to the competition; they may code any type of software they want, as long as it is Free Software. The software project can be a stand-alone program written from scratch, or you can modify or combine existing programs. Everything is welcome! The participants will have the chance to briefly follow each other’s work and exchange ideas.]]></summary>

Introduction

Google Cloud offers three distinct ways of running your code or application in a serverless way, each serving different use cases. Google App Engine, our first Cloud product, was created to give users the ability to deploy source-based web applications or mobile backends directly to the cloud without the need of thinking about servers or scaling. Cloud Functions came later for scenarios where you may not have an entire app, great for one-off utility functions or event-driven microservices. Cloud Run is our latest fully-managed serverless product that gives developers the flexibility of containers along with the convenience of serverless. 
As all are serverless compute platforms, users recognize they share so…]]></summary>

내가 컴퓨터공학 학부 2학년을 다니던 2009년 즈음, 전공 2학년 때 배우는 객체지향 프로그래밍 시간에는 C++을 배웠었다. 서점에 갔는데, C/C++ 및 자료구조의 '열혈 프로그래밍' 시리즈로 유명한 윤성우님이 JAVA 프로그래밍 책을 출간하셨다. 놀랍게도 제목은 [난 정말 JAVA를 공부한 적이 없다구요]였다(이 책은 현재 '열혈 Java 프로그래밍'으로 개정되어 출간되었다). 그 당시 잠시 책을 살펴보긴 했지만, C++과는 코딩 스타일이 너무 다르다는 생각에 우선은 배우기를 보류했던 기억이 난다. 그런데 내가 졸업하고 몇 년 뒤부터는 학부과정 수업이 JAVA로 바뀌었다는 소식을 전해 들었다. 결과적으로 나는 JAVA를 배운 적이 없었다.
학교를 졸업하고 군대에 가서 프로그래밍을 할 일이 많았는데, 물론 대다수의 공공기관은 전자정부 표준프레임워크 사용에 따라 JAVA를 사용할 일이 많았다. 하지만 난 여전히 C/C++을 선호하던 관성을 따르고 싶었기에 꼭 필요한 경우가 아니면 JAVA를 회피했다. 현재의 나는 주로 Python을 사용하고 golang도 배우고 있지만 이상하게도 아직까지 굳이 JAVA를 직접적으로 사용할 일은 극히 드문 상황이다. 어쩌면 내가 의도적으로 피했기 때문은 아닐까 하는 생각도 들었다. 다른 프로그래밍 언어를 알고 있으므로, 남이 작성한 자바 코드를 보고 어느 정도 읽고 이해하고 약간 수정할 줄은 알지만, 굳이 JAVA를 사용하여 프로그램을 만들고 싶은 적은 없었던 것이다.

Tim and I would spend our day "playing" with the floor model of the PDP-8 they had at the office.  The office staff were very accommodating and accepting of our presence, and they helped us out if we needed any fresh rolls of teleprinter paper, or paper tape.

lengthy missive from Lennart Poettering taking Linux distributors to
task for inadequately protecting systems from physical attacks.


	So, does the scheme so far implemented by generic Linux
	distributions protect us against the latter two scenarios?
	Unfortunately not at all. Because distributions set up disk
	encryption the way they do, and only bind it to a user password, an
	attacker can easily duplicate the disk, and then attempt to brute
	force your password. What's worse: since code authentication ends
	at the kernel — and the initrd is not authenticated anymore —,
	backdooring is trivially easy: an attacker can change the initrd
	any way they want, without having to fight any kind of protections.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over at the Guix-HPC blog, Ludovic Courtès writes about trying to package the PyTorch machine-learning library for the Guix distribution.  Building from source in a user-verifiable manner is part of the philosophy behind Guix, but there were a number of problems that were encountered:

The first surprise when starting packaging PyTorch is that, despite being on PyPI, PyTorch is first and foremost a large C++ code base. It does have a setup.py as commonly found in pure Python packages, but that file delegates the bulk of the work to CMake.

The second surprise is that PyTorch bundles (or "vendors", as some would say) source code for no less than 41 dependencies, ranging from small Python and C++ helper libraries to large C++ neural network tools. Like other distributions such as Debian, Guix avoids bundling: we would rather have one Guix package for each of these dependencies. The rationale is manifold, but it boils down to keeping things auditable, reducing resource usage, and making security updates practical.]]></summary>

Yara Elkady, Google Developer Student Club (GDSC) Lead, can trace her passion for tech all the way back to a single moment. She was sitting in computer class when her middle school teacher posed a question to the class: 

“Did you know that you can create apps and games like the ones that you spend so much time on?”

It was a simple question, but it was enough to plant the seed that would define the trajectory of Yara’s career. Following in the footsteps of so many beginners before her, Yara did a Google search to find out more about creating apps. She didn’t realize it at the time, but Yara had just taken her first steps down the path to becoming a developer.

unfortunately in many ways, a big part of today's internet.  While middleboxes
inhabit the same physical niche as routers, they are not aimed at packet forwarding;
instead they are meant to monitor and manipulate the packets that they

unfortunate as well, but the rest of the internet is only affected when
trying to communicate with those users—or so it was thought.  Based on some

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ben Hoyt has published a critical
overview of the Python 3.10 pattern-matching feature.


	As shown above, there are cases where match really
	shines. But they are few and far between, mostly when handling
	syntax trees and writing parsers. A lot of code does have
	if ... elif chains, but these are often either
	plain switch-on-value, where elif works almost as well, or
	the conditions they’re testing are a more complex combination of
	tests that don’t fit into case patterns (unless you use awkward
	case _ if cond clauses, but that’s strictly worse than
	elif).


(Pattern matching has been covered here as
well).]]></summary>

 Google Developers Experts is a global community of developers, engineers and thought leaders who passionately share their technical knowledge with others.  
Becoming a Google Developers Expert is no easy task. First, you need to have strong skills in one of the technical areas - Android, Kotlin, Google Cloud, Machine Learning, Web Technologies, Angular, Firebase, Google Workspace, Flutter or other. You also need to have a track record of sharing your knowledge - be it via conference talks, your personal blog, youtube videos or in some other form. Finally, you need one more thing. The courage to approach an existing Expert or a Google employee and ask them to support your application. 
It’s not easy, but it’s worth it. Joining the Experts community comes…]]></summary>

So I've spent a fair amount of this week trying to sort out all the
odd warnings, and I want to particularly thank Guenter Roeck for his
work on tracking where the build failures due to -Werror come from.

Is it done? No. But on the whole I'm feeling fairly good about this
all, even if it has meant that I've been looking at some really odd
and grotty code. Who knew I'd still worry about some odd EISA driver
on alpha, after all these years? A slight change of pace ;)]]></summary>

post from Christian Schaller describing a number of the
desktop-oriented improvements that can be expected in the Fedora 35
release.


	And I know some people will wonder why we spent so much time
	working with NVidia around their binary driver, but the reality is
	that NVidia is the market leader, especially in the professional
	Linux workstation space, and there are lot of people who either
	would end up not using Linux or using Linux with X without it,
	including a lot of Red Hat customers and Fedora users. And that is

at the difficulties caused by the OpenSSL 3 transition in the
context of Alpine Linux.


	For distributions, however, the story is different:
	cryptography moved to using Rust, because they wanted to
	leverage all of the static analysis capabilities built into the
	language.  This, too, is a reasonable decision, from a development
	perspective.  From the ecosystem perspective, however, it is
	problematic, as the Rust ecosystem is still rapidly evolving, and
	so we cannot support a single branch of the Rust compiler for an
	entire 2 year lifecycle, which means it exists in community.  Our
	solution, historically, has been to hold cryptography at
	the latest version that did not require Rust to build.  However,
	that version is not compatible with OpenSSL 3, and so it will
	eventually need to be upgraded to a new version which is.  And so,
	since cryptography has to move to community, so does

A lot of the problems probably arise from the lack of official documentation about working with coroutines. We have been given C++ syntax support for coroutines (the co_yield and co_return) but without [...]

Years ago, OpenBSD gained two new security system calls, pledge(2)
(originally tame(2)) and unveil. In both, an application
surrenders capabilities at run-time. The idea is to perform initialization
like usual, then drop capabilities before handling untrusted input,
limiting unwanted side effects. This feature is applicable even where type
safety isn’t an issue, such as Python, where a program might still get
tricked into accessing sensitive files or making network connections when
it shouldn’t. So how can a Python program access these system calls?
As discussed previously, it’s quite easy to access C APIs from
Python through its ctypes package, and this is no exception.

coincidence I happened to be thinking about code names myself while

repeats. The UFOpaedia page on the topic gives the word lists: 53
adjectives and 76 nouns, for a total of 4028 possible code names. A
typical game has around 60 missions, and if code names are generated
naively on the fly, then per the birthday paradox around half of all games
will see a repeated mission code name! Fortunately this is easy to avoid,
and the particular configuration here lends itself to an interesting
implementation.
