                    <span>To implement its safety guarantees, the Rust compiler keeps careful track
of ownership and references throughout a program. This makes writing certain
kinds of data structures challenging; in particular, data structures that have
circular references.
Let&#x27;s start with a simple binary tree:
struct Tree {
    root: Option&lt;Node&gt;,

                    <span>미루고 미루던 리눅스 커널 취약점 연구를 올해가 가기 전에 최소한 &#x27;시작&#x27;은 해보려고 한다. 
아직 초보인데, Defenit팀의 김현우(V4bel)님께서 인프런에서 진행하시는 강좌가 정말 큰 도움이 되었다.
https://www.inflearn.com/course/%EB%A6%AC%EB%88%85%EC%8A%A4-%EC%BB%A4%EB%84%90-%ED%95%B4%ED%82%B9/
해당 강좌는 Intel x86_64 환경을 기준으로 되어있는데, 이를 Aarch64 리눅스로 하여 열심히 삽질 중이다. 변환했을 때 똑같이 적용되는 것도 있고, 안 되는 것도 많다..


우선 Aarch64 환경에서 커널 빌드 및 디버깅을 하기 위한 절차를 기록해둔다. 대부분의 내용은 위에서 언급한 강좌에서 김현우님께서 가이드해주신 방법을 참고했으며, Aarch64 로 변환할 때 필요한 수정사항들을 내가 작성했다(이 게시물은 강사님의 허락을 받고 기록해두는 것이다.)
 
(참고로 1~3번 과정을 생략하고, 내가 올려둔 파일을 다운로드 하셔도 됨)
1. 리눅스 커널 빌드
우선 리눅스 커널을 직접 빌드할 수 있는 환경이 마련되어야 한다. 강의에서는 인텔 리눅스 상에서 인텔 리눅스를 빌드하는 방식으로 진행되었다. 그러나 Aarch64 아키텍처용 리눅스를 빌드하려면 방법이 달라진다. 대략 두가지 방법이 있다.
1) Intel 리눅스상에서 cross-compiler 를 사용해서 Aarch64 리눅스 이미지를 빌드하는 방법.
2) Aarch64 리눅스 상에서 Aarch64 리눅스를 빌드하는 방법.
그동안은 대부분 1의 방법이 선호되었다. 왜냐…</span>

                    <span>Over on the Google Security blog, Jonathan Metzman announced the release of ClusterFuzzLite, which is &quot;a continuous fuzzing solution that runs as part of CI/CD workflows to find vulnerabilities faster than ever before&quot;.   ClusterFuzzLite is a descendant of OSS-Fuzz, which we looked at in 2017.

Large projects including systemd and curl are already using ClusterFuzzLite during code review, with positive results. According to Daniel Stenberg, author of curl, “When the human reviewers nod and have approved the code and your static code analyzers and linters can&#x27;t detect any more issues, fuzzing is what takes you to the next level of code maturity and robustness. OSS-Fuzz and ClusterFuzzLite help us maintain curl as a quality project, around the clock, every day and every commit.”

[...] To learn more, check out the ClusterFuzzLite documentation. ClusterFuzzLite currently supports GitHub Actions, Google Cloud Build and Prow. We built this with CI system extensibility in mind, and adding support for other CI systems is straightforward. Please contact us if you’re interested in contributing support, or have any questions, feedback or feature requests.</span>

the kernel, with an ongoing reliance on various heuristics for

                    <span>People often see work in support as something negative. Today we&#x27;ll look at it from a different perspective. This article is about a real communication of 100+ messages, exceptions, the analysis that didn&#x27;t complete in three days... Actually, bug reports are great If a bug report is adequately handled from both sides, it means that both the user and the software developer are interested in solving the problem. If both sides achieve the desired result, it&#x27;s a win-win situation. Before we proceed to the story, here&#x27;s a little introduction. We are the PVS-Studio team. We develop the analyzer that searches for errors and potential vulnerabilities in C, C++, C#, and Java code.

                    <span>While the &quot;Trojan Source&quot; vulnerabilities
have, thus far, generated far more publicity than examples of actual
exploits, addressing the problem still seems like a good thing to do.
There are several places where defenses could be put into place; text
editors, being the place where developers look at a lot of code, are one
obvious example.  The discussion of how to enhance Emacs in this regard has
made it clear, though, that there are multiple opinions about how an editor
should flag potential attacks.</span>

                    <span>On November 10, the Go programming language community celebrated the 12th anniversary of its release as open-source software.  The post covers a number of different topics, including the consolidation of web sites at go.dev, releases and their features over the last year, as well as a look to the future:

In February, the Go 1.18 release will expand the new register-based calling convention to non-x86 architectures, bringing dramatic performance improvements with it. It will include the new Go fuzzing support. And it will be the first release to include support for generics.

Generics will be one of our focuses for 2022. The initial release in Go 1.18 is only the beginning. We need to spend time using generics and learning what works and what doesn’t, so that we can write best practices and decide what should be added to the standard library and other libraries. We expect that Go 1.19 (expected in August 2022) and later releases will further refine the design and implementation of generics as well as integrating them further into the overall Go experience.</span>

(1) 시간은 무한성과 자족성을 존재자에게 보장해 줄 수 없는 관계이다. (2) 시간은 사회성을 뜻하는 관계이다. (3) 시간은 존재자의 존재라는 존재의 지평이 아니라, 존재 저편의 방식으로, 즉 타자에 대한 사유 관계이다. (4) 시간은 타인의 얼굴.......</span>

                    <span>Python supports default values for arguments to functions, but those
defaults are evaluated at function-definition time.  A proposal to add
defaults that are evaluated when the function is called has been discussed
at some length on the python-ideas mailing list.  The idea came about, in part,
due to yet another resurrection of the proposal
for None-aware operators in Python.  Late-bound defaults would help
with one use case for those operators, but there are other, stronger
reasons to consider their addition to the language.</span>

                    <span>Good technical design decisions are very dependent on context. Teams that
    regularly work together on common goals are able to communicate regularly
    and negotiate changes quickly. These teams exhibit a strong force of
    alignment, and can make technology and design decisions that harness that
    strong force. As we zoom out in a larger organisation an increasingly
    weak force exists between teams and divisions that work independently
    and have less frequent collaboration. Recognising the differences in these
    strong and weak forces allows us to make better decisions and give better
    guidance for each level, allowing for more empowered teams that can move
    faster.

                    <span>Within each normal-sized team, limit the choice of alternatives for any class
	of technology to three. These are: the current sensible default, the one we&#x27;re
	experimenting with as a trial, and the one that we hate and want to retire.
The conversation goes like this: We want to introduce a new messaging
  technology. How many do we have already in place? Oh we have three in active
  use, including one that&#x27;s considered legacy and we&#x27;re partway through
  migrating off and one that we experimented with previously but didn&#x27;t gain
  traction. Ok, so we&#x27;re at our limit now. If we want to add another messaging
  tech then we have two choices. Either migrate all of our apps off the legacy
  tech, or properly rid ourselves of the failed experiment. This is quite
  closely related to the idea of capping the number of Innovation Tokens in
  use within your teams.
At a team level these kinds of limits are relatively easy
  to maintain and discuss and act upon, because we have common priorities and
  ways of working and high trust, high bandwidth communication. At the scope of
  the whole organisation the challenge is similar, but getting alignment takes a
  lot longer and doing actual migration and consolidation work can take a long
  time - so we sometimes have to allow for more variation in technology. We also use 
  different techniques to discuss and communicate the status of our preferred technologies.
An approach we use at MYOB to engage our whole organisation in broader decisions about
  technology is by publishing our own MYOB Technology Radar, following the
  format of the Thoughtworks Technology Radar.
  This approach of building our own radar
  involves taking input from all of our verticals and teams, and making a clear
  statement on what technologies we encourage teams to adopt, trial, or more
  importantly which ones to keep clear of.</span>

On the other hand – you have to perform advanced research to find the right tool for your team. Before we talk about selection criteria, let&#x27;s briefly discuss the methodology. Static analysis is an automated method to find errors in source code by means of specialized programs. The purpose of such analysis is to identify unsafe and problem parts of the project that can lead to more serious consequences – vulnerabilities. Keep in mind that users are not QA engineers. Bugs must not get into the release. That is why it&#x27;s better to use a static analyzer regularly. Run the analyzer once – get lots of messages. Believe us, you don&#x27;t want to sort them out.

                    <span>The Julia programming language has
its roots in high-performance scientific computing, so it is no surprise
that it has facilities for concurrent processing. Those features are not
well-known outside of the Julia community, though, so it is interesting to
see the different types of parallel and concurrent computation that the
language supports. In addition, the upcoming release of Julia
version 1.7 brings an improvement to the language&#x27;s
concurrent-computation palette, 
in the form of &quot;task 
migration&quot;.</span>

Getting people to show up to meetings on time
Incentive: dock pay for people who are late
Process: don&#x27;t allow anyone who&#x27;s late into the meeting
Culture: people feel strongly about showing up on time



Getting people to build complex systems
Incentive: require complexity in promo criteria
Process: make process for creating or executing on a work item so heavyweight that people stop doing simple work

                    <span>The LXD team has announced
the release of version 4.20 of the LXD system container and virtual
machine manager.

This is one very busy release with a lot of new features.

VM users will be happy to see the initial implementation of live migration and core scheduling support. Container users are getting new configuration keys to set sysctls.

Then the bulk of the new features are all network related with peer network relationships, network zones for auto-generated DNS and SR-IOV accelerated OVN networks.

And lastly, on the clustering front, it’s now possible to better control what servers will be receiving new workloads.</span>

yet.  Upcoming Intel processors will feature a new set of instructions
under the name of &quot;Advanced Matrix Extensions&quot; (AMX) that can be used to
operate on matrix data.  After a somewhat bumpy development
process, support for AMX has found its way into the upcoming 5.16 kernel.

6 Ways to Refactor new/delete into unique ptr - C++ Stories
Basic assumptions
The code presented here will usually contain explicit new and delete, and we’d like to reduce their use and wrap resources (pointers) into RAII.
We’ll try to follow the rule: R.11: Avoid calling new and delete explicitly from the Core C++ Guidelines:

With the recent release of macOS 12 Monterey, we noticed that tkinter

including in our built-in IDLE. Thanks to rapid help from the Tk team, 
and Marc Culler in particular, we were able to fix the issue by bundling
 Python 3.9.8 and Python 3.11.0a2 with a fixed Tcl/Tk version. In 3.9.8 
it’s a patched 8.6.11 release while 3.11.0a2 is rocking the 
bleeding-edge 8.6.12rc1.

Since the issue also affected our latest stable version, 3.10.0, an 
updated macOS installer for this version was issued. You can recognize 
it by the post2 version appendix: python-3.10.0post2-macos11.pkg.

the &quot;local email interface&quot; (lei) functionality for the lore archive of
kernel mailing lists.


	Even though it started out as merely a list archival service, it
	quickly became obvious that lore could be used for a lot more. Many
	developers ended up using its search features to quickly locate
	emails of interest, which in turn raised a simple question — what
	if there was a way to “save a search” and have it deliver all new

of block-layer optimizations that enabled a suitably equipped system to
sustain 3.5 million I/O operations per second (IOPS).  That
optimization work has continued since then, and those 3.5 million IOPS
would be a deeply disappointing result now.  A recent disagreement over the
addition of a new feature has highlighted the potential cost of a heavily
optimized block layer, though; when is a feature deemed important enough to

	The cycle of patching on both sides is ongoing to this day. A
	friend of mine on Twitter referred to this tug-of-war as “core
	war,” which is an apt description: all of the involved actors are
	trying to patch each other out of being able to commit or detect
	subterfuge, and your browser gets slower and slower as more
	mitigations and countermeasures are layered on. If you’re not using
	an ad blocker yet, stop reading this, and install one: your browser
	will suddenly be a lot more performant.</span>

                    <span>The Record is reporting
on massive exploitation of an oldish vulnerability in GitLab instances.


	While the purpose of these attacks remained unclear for HN
	Security, yesterday, Google’s Menscher said the hacked servers were
	part of a botnet comprising of “thousands of compromised GitLab
	instances” that was launching large-scale DDoS attacks.


The vulnerability was fixed
in April, but evidently a lot of sites have not updated.</span>

Finding at least something is already an achievement. Let&#x27;s give it a shot. I am writing about Protocol Buffers (protobuf) as part of a long-term series of articles about checking open-source projects. The library implements a protocol for structured data serialization. This is an effective binary alternative to the XML text format. The project seemed like an intriguing challenge for the PVS-Studio analyzer, because Google takes a very serious approach to the quality of the C++ code it produces. Take, for example, the &quot;Safer Usage of C++&quot; document that has been actively discussed recently. Additionally, many developers use protobuf in their projects - which means the protobuf product is well-tested. Finding at least a couple of mistakes in this project is a challenge that we have taken upon us. So what are we waiting for? Time to find out what PVS-Studio can do!</span>

                    <span>Over at the SAMBA+ blog, the performance of the new ksmbd kernel SMB server and Samba in user space are compared:

ksmbd claims performance improvements on a wide range of benchmarks: the graphs on this page show a doubling of performance on some tests. There was also the notion that an in-kernel server is likely an easier place to support SMB Direct, which uses RDMA to transfer data between systems.

Clearly, those number are impressive, but at the same time recent improvements in Samba&#x27;s IO performance put this into perspective: by leveraging the new &quot;io_uring&quot; Linux API Samba is able to provide roughly 10x the throughput compared to ksmbd.

Time will tell whether it&#x27;s better to reside in kernel-space like ksmbd or in user-space like Samba in order to squeeze the last bit of performance out of the available hardware.


There are two graphs that show some impressive results for Samba.</span>

                    <span>Patrick Horgan explains
the process of starting a program on Linux in great detail.



	Well, __libc_start_main calls __libc_init_first,
	who immediately uses secret inside information to find the
	environment variables just after the terminating null of the
	argument vector and then sets a global variable __environ
	which __libc_start_main uses thereafter whenever it needs
	it including when it calls main. After the envp
	is established, then __libc_start_main uses the same trick
	and surprise! Just past the terminating null at the end of the
	envp array, there&#x27;s another vector, the ELF auxiliary
	vector the loader uses to pass some information to the process. An
	easy way to see what&#x27;s in there is to set the environment variable
	LD_SHOW_AUXV&#x3D;1 before running the program.</span>

changesets into the mainline repository for the 5.16 kernel release.  That
is probably a little over half of what will arrive during this merge
window, so this is a good time to catch up on what has been pulled so far.
There are many significant changes and some large-scale restructuring of
internal kernel code, but relatively few ground-breaking new

                    <span>A new security vulnerability that was disclosed
on November 1 has some interesting properties.  &quot;Trojan Source&quot;, as it has been
dubbed, is effectively an attack on human perceptions, especially as they
are filtered through the tools used for source-code review.  While the
specifics of the flaw are new, this kind of trickery is not completely
novel, but Trojan Source finds another way to confuse the humans who are
in the loop.</span>

But we need to run retro games on something, right? This time we checked a project that helps to run old games on modern hardware. DuckStation is an emulator of the Sony PlayStation console. The emulator, according to its website, has a version for Windows, Linux, and for Android smartphones. And recently it was launched on Xbox Series X and S. The project itself contains slightly less than a million lines of C and C++ code. DuckStation doesn&#x27;t release updates. Its developers regularly commit changes. So, we had to fixate the SHA of the commit: 13c5ee8. We checked the project and found a lot of warnings - 170 of the High level and 434 of the Medium level.

apt.llvm.org from physical hardware hosted in
a datacenter to the Google cloud. This has resulted in better security
and faster builds for LLVM Debian/Ubuntu nightly builds.
Previous infrastructure
About 10 years ago, Nick Lewycky from Google offered to replace my mix
of old and terrible servers with 16 blade servers in a chassis and a
control server. Below are pictures of the front and back of these
servers, which have served us faithfully for 10 years:
 
The hosting was sponsored by IRILL, at
Inria, next to Versailles.
This setup was running using a PXE install with preseed to set up
everything on the 16 blades.
While it served us very well for years, it is now holding us back.
Some of the blades are dying;

                    <span>While it is often relatively straightforward to determine what package
provided a binary that is misbehaving—crashing for instance—on Fedora and
other Linux distributions, there are situations where it may be harder to
do so.  A feature recently proposed for Fedora 36—currently
scheduled for the end of April 2022—would embed information into the
binaries themselves to show where they came from.  It is part of a
multi-distribution effort to standardize how this information is stored in
the binaries (and the libraries they use) to assist crash-reporting and other tools.</span>

                    <span>Integrating the necessary security controls and audit capabilities to
      satisfy compliance requirements within a DevOps culture can capitalize on
      CI/CD pipeline automation, but presents unique challenges as an
      organization scales. Understanding the second order implications and
      unintended consequences caused by the chosen implementation is key to
      building an effective, secure, and scalable solution. My colleague Carl
      Nygard describes how to think of these choices through a
      series of four patterns for handling compliance.

                    <span>Mach-O 는 macOS에서 사용하는 바이너리 형식 포맷이다. 기존에는 애플도 인텔 칩셋을 사용했기 때문에 바이너리도 인텔용 바이너리로 사용되었다.
그러나 2020년 M1칩을 발표하면서부터 macOS는 ARM64로 전환되었고, 이에 따라 바이너리 형식 역시 ARM64를 따르게 되었다. 물론 원래부터 iOS를 구동하는 아이폰 및 아이패드가 ARM 디바이스였으므로 완전히 새로운 내용은 아니다. 다만 성능 차원에서 훨씬 뛰어난데다가 컴퓨터용 운영체제인 macOS가 ARM64를 지원하게 되었고, 2021년 계속해서 M1 Max 등 새로운 칩셋들을 계속 ARM64로 고수하고 있으므로 향후에는 결국 ARM64 기반의 Mach-O가 완전히 자리잡을 것으로 보인다.
한편 M1 칩셋 환경을 대상으로 하는 M1 악성코드가 출현하고 있다(참고 : GoSearch22). 그러므로 M1 환경에서 악성코드 분석이라던지 취약점 분석을 하기 위해서는 M1용 바이너리를 역공학(reverse engineering) 하는 방법을 필수적으로 숙지해야 할 것이다.
물론 리버싱 실무에서 사실상의 표준 도구로 사용되는 IDA Pro 같은 경우 이미 ARM64 macOS 에 대한 지원 업데이트를 출시했다. .. 역시 자본주의 사회에서는 돈이 .. 최고다..  이 글에서는 IDA를 사용하지 않고, 순수하게 디스어셈블 도구를 사용하여 어셈블리 언어 수준의 분석을 수행해보는 것으로 한다.

Easily connect Google Pay with your preferred payment processor
  
Adding Google Pay as a payment method to your website or Android application provides a secure and fast checkout option for your users. To enable Google Pay, you will first need a Payment Service Provider (PSP). For the integration this means understanding how your payments processing stack works with Google Pay APIs.  
End-to-end PSP samples
 To make integration easier, we’ve launched a new open source project containing end-to-end samples for a range of PSPs, demonstrating the entire integration process - from client-side configuration, to server-side integration with the PSPs, using their respective APIs and client libraries where applicable.

One of the changes I made was to populate the initial space with a few random bases scattered here and there.  This would allow the player some extra resources with which to battle the Klingons while building up a network of more bases.
While I was playing the modified game, it crashed.  Hard.
Now I wrote this with TDD, and I was very disciplined about the cleanliness of the code, and the test coverage.  So this was unexpected.  So I dug up all my old debugging skills from the pit in which I had buried them, and started to work out what was going on.

This might surprise people who have known me or read my work for years, because I have spent the majority of my career extolling the benefits of CI pipelines and automated …

When Chloe Quijano arrived at the University of Toronto to study Applied Sciences, she immediately noticed that few of the professors or teaching assistants in the program looked like her. She noticed a lack of relatable role models online and on social media as well. 
Chloe felt strongly about the importance of representation.  Whether based on race, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation or disability status, she understood the importance of being able to find relatable role models in her field--and the implications of a lack of diversity.  &quot;It holds back the students wishing to go into the field,&quot; she says.

                    <span>Smart pointers are very versatile and can hold pointers not only to single instances but also to arrays. Is that only a theoretical use case? or maybe they might be handy in some cases? Let’s have a look.
Smart pointers for T[]
At C++ Stories, you can find lots of information about smart pointers - see this separate tag for this area. For completeness, I’d like to mention an interesting issue on smart pointers and arrays.
If you want to create a unique_ptr, you can write:
class Object { };

// unique_ptr
auto ptr &#x3D; std::make_unique();
auto intPtr &#x3D; std::make_unique();

// or shared_ptr
auto shared &#x3D; std::make_shared();
auto intShared &#x3D; std::make_shared();


In the example, you see pointers to a single instance of Object or an integer.
Similarly, if you want to hav…</span>

                    <span>Since the early days, Unix-like systems have implemented the concept of
process priorities, where higher-priority processes are given more
CPU time to get their work done.  Implementations have changed, and
alternatives (such as deadline scheduling)
are available for specialized situations, but the core priority (or, in an
inverted sense, &quot;niceness&quot;) concept 
remains essentially the same.  What should happen, though, in a world where
increasing amounts of computing work is done outside of the CPU?  Tvrtko
Ursulin has put together a
patch set showing how the nice mechanism can be extended to GPUs as

To cover this category in PVS-Studio, developers have to turn the analyzer into a full SCA solution. How will the analyzer look for vulnerabilities in the components used? What is SCA? Let&#x27;s try to find the answers in this article! One of the priority areas for PVS-Studio development is to cover categories from the OWASP Top Ten 2017 in the C# analyzer. We also plan to cover the Top Ten 2021 in the future. The most unusual for us is the A9:2017 category - Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities. This category has the A6 position in the preliminary version of OWASP 2021. The rule implementation for this category is an important task for our analyzer. It allows us to classify PVS-Studio as an SCA (Software Composition Analysis) tool. Which approach to implementation should we choose? Let&#x27;s figure it out! The A9 threat category (It turned into A6 in the preliminary OWASP 2021 version) is dedicated to using components with known vulnerabilities. These are the components that have the corresponding entries in the CVE database.

                    <span>People frequently1 think that I&#x27;m very stupid. I don&#x27;t find this surprising, since I don&#x27;t mind if other people think I&#x27;m stupid, which means that I don&#x27;t adjust my behavior to avoid seeming stupid, which results in people thinking that I&#x27;m stupid. Although there are some downsides to people thinking that I&#x27;m stupid, e.g., failing interviews where the interviewer very clearly thought I was stupid, I think that, overall, the upsides of being willing to look stupid have greatly outweighed the downsides.
I don&#x27;t know why this one example sticks in my head but, for me, the most memorable example of other people thinking that I&#x27;m stupid was from college. I&#x27;ve had numerous instances where more people thought I was stupid and also where people thought the depths of my stupidity was greater, but t…</span>

                    <span>The Jalopnik automotive site has posted an
article on a
(relatively) new set
of open-source tools that can extract log data from Tesla cars.


	Since Tesla cars run a Debian-based operating system, navigating
	through their file systems is somewhat trivial to anyone who’s
	spent a weekend messing with virtual Linux machines (or watching
	Mr. Robot). Actually accessing the car’s memory, however, is
	considerably harder: all cases require at least partially
	disassembling the dashboard, and some even require disassembly of
	the car’s media control unit.

	Once that’s done, however, the data trove is incredible.</span>

                    <span>The Rust language project has announced the release of stable version 1.56.0 and the Rust 2021 edition. 

We wrote about plans for the Rust 2021 Edition in May. Editions are a mechanism for opt-in changes that may otherwise pose backwards compatibility risk. See the edition guide for details on how this is achieved. This is a smaller edition, especially compared to 2018, but there are still some nice quality-of-life changes that require an edition opt-in to avoid breaking some corner cases in existing code.


See the detailed 
release notes for 1.56.0 for lots more information on the release.</span>

                    <span>For those who are curious about where the development of Git is headed:
Johannes Schindelin has posted an
extensive set of notes from the just-concluded Git Contributors&#x27;
Summit.


We held our second all-virtual Summit over the past two days. It was the
traditional unconference style meeting, with topics being proposed and
voted on right before the introduction round. It was really good to see
the human faces behind those email addresses.

32 contributors participated, and we spanned the timezones from PST to
IST.


Be sure to go into the thread for the full notes.</span>

                    <span>While the BPF virtual machine has been supported by Linux for most of
the kernel&#x27;s existence, its role for much of that time was limited to, as
its full
name (Berkeley packet filter) would suggest, filtering packets.  That began to change in 2012 with the introduction
of seccomp() filtering, and the pace picked up in 2014 with the arrival
of the extended BPF virtual machine.  At this point, BPF hooks have found their
way into many kernel subsystems.  One area that has remained BPF-free,
though, is the CPU scheduler; that could change if some version of
this patch
set from Roman Gushchin finds its way into the mainline.</span>

 The previous Module 7 episode of Serverless Migration Station gave developers an idea of how App Engine push tasks work and how to implement their use in an existing App Engine ndb Flask app. In this Module 8 episode, we migrate this app from the App Engine Datastore (ndb) and Task Queue (taskqueue) APIs to Cloud NDB and Cloud Tasks. This makes your app more portable and provides a smoother transition from Python 2 to 3. The same principle applies to upgrading other legacy App Engine apps from Java 8 to 11, PHP 5 to 7, and up to Go 1.12 or newer.

filed on October 19 by Software Freedom Conservancy (SFC)
against television maker Vizio.  Unlike previous GPL-enforcement suits, which
have been pursued on behalf of the developers and copyright holders of
GPL-licensed code, this suit has been filed on behalf of owners of the TVs
in question.  The idea that owners of devices that contain code under the
GPL have the right to access that code seems clearly embodied in the
license, but it remains to be seen if the courts will decide that those
owners have the legal standing to sue for relief.</span>

                    <span>Over at the Project Zero blog, Jann Horn has a lengthy post on a kernel bug, ways to exploit it, and various ideas on mitigation.  While the exploitation analysis is highly detailed, more than half of the post looks at various defenses to this kind of bug.


This blog post describes a straightforward Linux kernel locking bug and how I exploited it against Debian Buster&#x27;s 4.19.0-13-amd64 kernel. Based on that, it explores options for security mitigations that could prevent or hinder exploitation of issues similar to this one.

I hope that stepping through such an exploit and sharing this compiled knowledge with the wider security community can help with reasoning about the relative utility of various mitigation approaches.

A lot of the individual exploitation techniques and mitigation options that I am describing here aren&#x27;t novel. However, I believe that there is value in writing them up together to show how various mitigations interact with a fairly normal use-after-free exploit.</span>

                    <span>On October 11, the first release candidate for Qubes OS version 4.1 was announced. Qubes OS
is a security-oriented desktop operating system that uses multiple virtual
machines (VMs or &quot;qubes&quot;) to isolate
various types of functionality.  The idea is to compartmentalize different
applications and operating-system subsystems to protect them from each
other and to limit access to the user&#x27;s data if an application is
compromised.  Version 4.1 will bring several important enhancements to
help Qubes OS continue to live up to its motto: &quot;A reasonably secure operating
system&quot;.</span>

                    <span>Software Freedom Conservancy has announced that it filed suit against TV maker Vizio over &quot;repeated failures to fulfill even the basic requirements of the General Public License (GPL)&quot;.  The organization raised the problems with Vizio in August 2018, but the company stopped responding in January 2020, according to the announcement. 

&quot;We are asking the court to require Vizio to make good on its obligations under copyleft compliance requirements,&quot; says [Software Freedom Conservancy executive director Karen] Sandler. She explains that in past litigation, the plaintiffs have always been copyright holders of the specific GPL code. In this case, Software Freedom Conservancy hopes to demonstrate that it&#x27;s not just the copyright holders, but also the receivers of the licensed code who are entitled to rights.

The lawsuit suit seeks no monetary damages, but instead seeks access to the technical information that the copyleft licenses require Vizio to provide to all customers who purchase its TVs (specifically, the plaintiff is asking for the technical information via &quot;specific performance&quot; rather than &quot;damages&quot;).

                    <span>It&#x27;s common to see people advocate for learning skills that they have or using processes that they use. For example, Steve Yegge has a set of blog posts where he recommends reading compiler books and learning about compilers. His reasoning is basically that, if you understand compilers, you&#x27;ll see compiler problems everywhere and will recognize all of the cases where people are solving a compiler problem without using compiler knowledge. Instead of hacking together some half-baked solution that will never work, you can apply a bit of computer science knowledge to solve the problem in a better way with less effort. That&#x27;s not untrue, but it&#x27;s also not a reason to study compilers in particular because you can say that about many different areas of computer science and math. Queuing theory, c…</span>

                    <span>In legacy code, you can often spot explicit new and delete lurking in various places and waiting to produce pointer-related issues. This blog post shows six patterns to improve that erroneous style and rely on modern techniques, especially unique_ptr and other helper standard types.
unique_ptr.

Basic assumptions
The code presented here will usually contain explicit new and delete, and we’d like to reduce their use and wrap resources (usually for pointers to heap-allocated objects) into RAII.
Most importantly, we’ll try to follow the rule: R.11: Avoid calling new and delete explicitly from the Core C++ Guidelines:
The pointer returned by new should belong to a resource handle (that can call delete). If the pointer returned by new is assigned to a plain/naked pointer, the object can be leak…</span>

                    <span>Open source will catalyze the financial services industry’s biggest evolution to date. This evolution will shift the power in this $25 trillion industry from business executives to developers, not just in fintech companies, but in centuries-old incumbents, as well.    Until very recently, financial services were notoriously hard and expensive to build. Incumbents and startups alike... Read More

                    <span>The name Debian brings to mind a Linux
distribution, but the Debian project is far more than that; it is an
ongoing experiment in democratic project governance.  Debian&#x27;s processes
can result in a lot of public squabbling; one should not lose track,
though, of the fact that those processes have enabled a large community to
maintain and grow a complex distribution for decades without the benefit of
an overseeing corporate overlord.  Processes can be improved, though; a
recent proposal
from Russ Allbery gives an interesting picture of where the pain points
are and what can be made better.</span>
