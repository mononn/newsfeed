Developing your own custom Google Chat bot is a great way for users and teams to interact with your solutions and services both directly and within context as they collaborate in Chat. More specifically, Chat bots can be used in group conversations to streamline workflows, assist with activities in the context of discussions, and provide information and notifications in real time. Chat bots can also be used in direct messages, offering a new way to optimize workflows and personal productivity, such as managing project tasks or reporting time activity. Because use cases for bots are varied,  you can consistently reach a growing audience of Chat users over time, directly where they work and uh-hum, chat.

                    <span>Summer is almost here (at least in half of the planet) and Python 3.10 is finishing baking in the oven. For those of you that want to taste it before is finally ready (and if you are a library developer, you certainly do!) you can have the second-to-last beta now, but be careful as is very hot 
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100b3/
This is a beta preview of Python 3.10
Python 3.10 is still in development. 3.10.0b3 is the third of four planned beta release previews. Beta release previews are intended to give the wider community the opportunity to test new features and bug fixes and to prepare their projects to support the new feature release.
We **strongly encourage** maintainers of third-party Python projects to **test with 3.10** during the beta phase and report issues f…</span>

                    <span>Kernel development is not for people who lack persistence; changes can take
a number of revisions and a lot of time to make it into a mainline
release.  Even so, the story of the Landlock security module, developed by
Mickaël Salaün, seems like an extreme case; this code was merged for 5.13 after
more than five years of development and 34 versions of the patch set.
This sandboxing mechanism has evolved considerably since LWN covered version 3 of the patch set in
2016, so a look at what Landlock has become is warranted.</span>

                    <span>The Prossimo project has announced
that it has contracted with Miguel Ojeda to work on Rust in the Linux kernel
for the next year.  Prossimo is a new name for the memory-safety
projects being run by the Internet Security Research
Group (ISRG), which is the organization behind the Let&#x27;s Encrypt certificate authority
(CA) project.  Google provided the funds to enable Ojeda to work full-time
on the project starting back in April.


The Linux kernel is at the heart of the modern Internet, from
servers to client devices. It’s on the front line for processing network
data and other forms of input. As such, vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel
can have a wide-ranging impact, putting security and privacy for people,
organizations, and devices at risk. Since it’s written largely in the C
language, which is not memory-safe, memory safety vulnerabilities such as
buffer overflows and use-after-frees are a constant concern. By making it
possible to write parts of the Linux kernel in Rust, which is memory-safe,
we can entirely eliminate memory safety vulnerabilities from certain
components, such as drivers.


We have previously covered another
Prossimo project, which provides funding for
Rustls development, as well as Ojeda&#x27;s work
on Rust in the kernel.</span>

supply-chain attacks is something that concerns many in our
communities—and beyond.  Linux distributions provide a supply chain that
obviously needs to be protected against attackers injecting malicious code
into the update stream.  This problem recently came up on the Fedora devel
mailing list, which led to a discussion covering a few different topics.
For the most part, Fedora users are protected against such attacks, which

Usually tests, developers, or testers detect such applications&#x27; drawbacks. In the worst case, users find weaknesses and report back. Alas, detecting defects is only the first step. Next, we should localize the problem. Otherwise, we won&#x27;t solve it. Here comes a question - how to find weak points that lead to excessive memory consumption and slow down in a large project? Are there such at all? Maybe it&#x27;s not about the application? So now you&#x27;re reading a story how PVS-Studio C# developers encountered a similar problem and managed to solve it.</span>

 As developers, it’s our responsibility to help keep our users safe online and protect their data. This starts with building products that are secure by default, private by design, and put users in control. Everything we make at Google is underpinned by these principles, and we’re proud to be an industry leader  in developing, deploying, and scaling new privacy-preserving technologies that make it possible to learn valuable insights and create helpful experiences while protecting our users’ privacy.  
That’s why today, we are excited to announce that we’re open-sourcing a first-of-its-kind, general-purpose transpiler for Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), which will enable developers to compute on encrypte…</span>

                    <span>물 건너가는 걸까? 오는 8월 KBS 이사회와 MBC 관리·감독기구인 방송문화진흥회, 9월 EBS 이사회, 12월 KBS 사장 선임이 예정돼 있다. 6월까지 방송법 개정이 이뤄져야만 새 법에 따라 공영방송 이사와 사장 선임이 가능하다는데 벌써 6월 중순이다. 올해 들어 많은 사람들이 공영방송 지배구조를 바꾸기 위한 방송법 개정을 적극 주장해왔고, 최근 그 목소리가 더 커지고 있다. 6월 7일부터 언론·시민사회단체들이 […]</span>

                    <span>The Google Developers Blog has this
announcement describing the release of a fully
homomorphic encryption project under the Apache license.
&quot;With FHE, encrypted data can travel across the Internet to a server,
where it can be processed without being decrypted. Google’s transpiler will
enable developers to write code for any type of basic computation such as
simple string processing or math, and run it on encrypted data. The
transpiler will transform that code into a version that can run on
encrypted data. This then allows developers to create new programming
applications that don’t need unencrypted data.&quot;  See this
white paper for more details on how it all works.</span>

                    <span>Free-software development is meant to be fun, at least some of the time.
Even developers of database-management systems seem to think that it is
fun; there is no accounting for taste, it seems.  Part of having fun is
certainly allowing the occasional exercise of one&#x27;s sense of humor while
working on the code.  But, as some recent &quot;fix&quot; attempts show, humor does
not always carry through to developers all over the planet.  Balancing
humor and inclusiveness is always going to be a challenge for our community.</span>

                    <span>Over on the Mozilla blog, Eric Rescorla looks
into some of the privacy implications of the Federated Learning of Cohorts
(FLoC), which is a Google effort to replace
third-party cookies with a different type of identifier that is less
trackable. But less tracking does not equal no tracking. &quot;People&#x27;s
interests aren&#x27;t constant and neither are their FLoC IDs. Currently, FLoC
IDs seem to be recomputed every week or so. This means that if a tracker is
able to use other information to link up user visits over time, they can
use the combination of FLoC IDs in week 1, week 2, etc. to distinguish
individual users. This is a particular concern because it works even with
modern anti-tracking mechanisms such as Firefox&#x27;s Total
Cookie Protection 
(TCP). TCP is intended to prevent trackers from correlating visits across
sites but not multiple visits to one site. FLoC restores cross-site
tracking even if users have TCP enabled.&quot;</span>

                    <span>In a lengthy
blog post, Lennart Poettering describes the advantages of using the
unique IDs (UUIDs) and flags from the discoverable partitions
specification to label the entries in a GUID Partition
Table (GPT).  That information can be used to tag disk images if a
self-descriptive way, so that external configuration files (such as
/etc/fstab) are not needed to assemble the filesystems for the
running system.  Systemd can use this information in a variety of ways,
including for running the image in a container: &quot;If a disk image
follows the Discoverable Partition Specification then systemd-nspawn has
all it needs to just boot it up. Specifically, if you have a GPT disk image
in a file foobar.raw and you want to boot it up in a container, just run
systemd-nspawn -i foobar.raw -b, and that&#x27;s it (you can specify a block
device like /dev/sdb too if you like). It becomes easy and natural to
prepare disk images that can be booted either on a physical machine, inside
a virtual machine manager or inside such a container manager: the necessary
meta-information is included in the image, easily accessible before
actually looking into its file systems.&quot;</span>

                    <span>Extended BPF (eBPF), the general-purpose
execution 
engine inside of the Linux kernel, has proved helpful for tracing and
monitoring the system, for processing network packets, or generally for
extending the behavior of the kernel. So helpful, in fact, that developers
working on other operating systems have been watching it. Dave Thaler and
Poorna Gaddehosur, on behalf of Microsoft, recently
published an implementation of eBPF for Windows. A Linux feature making
its way to Windows, in itself, deserves attention. Even more so when that
feature has brought new degrees of programmability to the Linux kernel over
the last few years. This makes it especially interesting to look at what the
new project can do, and to ponder how the current ecosystem might evolve as
eBPF begins its journey toward Windows.</span>

                    <span>On the GitHub blog, Kevin Backhouse writes
about a privilege escalation vulnerability in polkit, which
&quot;enables an unprivileged local user to get a root shell on the
system&quot;  CVE-2021-3560
&quot;is triggered by starting a dbus-send command but killing it while
polkit is still in the middle of processing the request. [...] Why does
killing the dbus-send command cause an authentication bypass? The
vulnerability is in step four of the sequence of events listed above. What
happens if polkit asks dbus-daemon for the UID of connection :1.96, but
connection :1.96 no longer exists? dbus-daemon handles that situation
correctly and returns an error. But it turns out that polkit does not
handle that error correctly. In fact, polkit mishandles the error in a
particularly unfortunate way: rather than rejecting the request, it treats
the request as though it came from a process with UID 0. In other words, it
immediately authorizes the request because it thinks the request has come
from a root process.&quot;</span>

                    <span>Annotations in Python came late to the party; they were introduced in
Python 3 as a way to attach information to functions describing their arguments and
return values.  While that mechanism had obvious applications for adding
type information to Python functions, standardized interpretations for the
annotations came later with type hints.
But evaluating the annotations at function-definition time caused some
difficulties, especially with respect to forward references to type names,
so a Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) was created to postpone their
evaluation until they were needed. The PEP-described behavior was set to
become the default in the upcoming Python 3.10 release, but that is
not to be; the postponement of evaluation by default has itself been postponed in the
hopes of unwinding things.</span>

grow, it is worth looking at
one of the larger scale efforts to port C code that has existed for decades
to Rust. The uutils project aims to
rewrite all of the individual utilities included in the GNU Coreutils project in
Rust. Originally created by Jordi
Boggiano in 2013, the project aims to provide drop-in
replacements for the Coreutils programs, adding
the data-race protection and memory safety that Rust provides.</span>

 A little over 10 years ago, we launched the IT Residency Program (ITRP) at Google with a twofold mission: to provide exceptional tech support for Googlers and to empower the next generation of IT pioneers.  
ITRP’s founding principle is learning and development. In addition to formal on-the-job IT support training, the program takes its residents through a focused career development path, including a hands-on rotation in a specific Google function in their chosen specialty. For their part, the residents, who come from a wide spectrum of often non-traditional backgrounds, bring with them a passion for learning. ITRP converts that passion into real-world experience and equips them for a lifelong career in tech. 
Today, hundreds of Googlers are ITRP alums, working i…</span>

innovations that have found their way into the core kernel in the last
fifteen years or so.  There is more to it than that, though; the wider realtime
community is also doing 
interesting work in a number of areas that go beyond ensuring deterministic
response.  One example is Daniel Bristot de Oliveira&#x27;s runtime
verification patch set, which can monitor the kernel to ensure that it
is behaving the way one thinks it should.</span>

 Alerts for important device events, such as a delivery person arriving or the back door failing to lock, create a more beneficial and reassuring experience for your smart home device users. 
As we announced at I/O, you can now add proactive notifications and follow-up responses to your Smart Home Action to alert users to events in a timely, relevant and helpful fashion and better engage with your end users.  
 
 Notifications can either alert a user to an event that has occurred without them proactively issuing a request through the Assistant, or as a follow-up to verify that the user&#x27;s request has been fulfilled.  Each device event that triggers one of these notifications has a unique event id, which helps the Assistant route it to the app…</span>

managed a system-administration group.  At that time, most of the day-to-day
pain reliably came from two types of devices: modems and printers.  Modems
are more 
plentiful than ever now, but they have disappeared into interface
controllers and (usually) manage to behave themselves.  Printers, instead,
are still entirely capable of creating problems and forcing a
reconsideration of one&#x27;s life choices.
Behind the scenes, though, the situation has been getting better but, as a
recent conversation within the Fedora project made clear, taking advantage
of those improvements will require some changes and a bit of a leap of faith.</span>

                    <span>The io_uring subsystem, first introduced in
2019, has quickly become the leading way to perform high-bandwidth,
asynchronous I/O.  It has drawn the attention of many developers, including,
more recently,
those who are focused more on security than performance.  Now some members
of the security 
community are lamenting a perceived lack of thought about security support in
io_uring, and are trying to remedy that shortcoming by adding audit and
Linux security module support there.  That process is proving difficult,
and has raised the prospect of an unpleasant fallback solution.</span>

                    <span>코로나19 바이러스로 전 세계에서 300만 명 이상이 목숨을 잃었습니다. 그러나 바이러스의 기원은 여전히 정확히 알려지지 않았습니다. 중국 우한에 있는 바이러스 연구소에서 코로나19 바이러스가 처음 생겼다는 주장은 한동안 말도 안 되는 음모론으로 치부됐지만, 최근 조금씩 지지를 얻고 있습니다. 워싱턴포스트가 이 주장을 둘러싼 논쟁을 총정리했습니다.</span>

And yet, I still want to cover my walls in them as tech-inspired wall decor. The company’s new Elements lights that are covered in […]

                    <span>When last we looked in on Fedora CoreOS back in December,
it was under consideration to become an official Fedora edition.  That has
not happened, yet at least, but it would seem that the CoreOS &quot;emerging edition&quot;
is still undergoing some difficulties trying to fit in with the rest of
Fedora.  There are differences between the needs of a container operating
system and those of more general-purpose distributions, which still need to
be worked out if Fedora CoreOS is going to &quot;graduate&quot;.</span>

                    <span>Robert McQueen takes
a look at the state of the GNOME Foundation.

[We’ve] got a larger staff team than GNOME has ever had before. We’ve widened the GNOME software ecosystem to include related apps and projects under the GNOME Circle banner, we’ve helped get GTK 4 out of the door, run a wider-reaching program in the Community Engagement Challenge, and consistently supported better infrastructure for both GNOME and the Linux app community in Flathub.

Aside from another grant from Endless (note: my employer), our fundraising hasn’t caught up with this pace of activities. As a result, the Board recently approved a budget for this financial year which will spend more funds from our reserves than we expect to raise in income. Due to our reserves policy, this is essentially the last time we can do this: over the next 6-12 months we need to either raise more money, or start spending less.</span>

Linux Enterprise source code like in previous versions, but built with the

                    <span>Matthew Garrett has written up the long,
complex series of steps required to build an x86 device that only boots
code that the creator wants to run there.  &quot;At this point everything
in the boot process is cryptographically verified, and so should be
difficult to tamper with. Unfortunately this isn&#x27;t really sufficient - on
x86 systems there&#x27;s typically no verification of the integrity of the
secure boot database. An attacker with physical access to the system could
attach a programmer directly to the firmware flash and rewrite the secure
boot database to include keys they control. They could then replace the
boot image with one that they&#x27;ve signed, and the machine would happily boot
code that the attacker controlled. We need to be able to demonstrate that
the system booted using the correct secure boot keys, and the only way we
can do that is to use the TPM.&quot;</span>

                    <span>There are arguments about whether a testing portfolio should be a
      pyramid or more like honeycomb. My second biggest issue with this argument
      is that it&#x27;s rendered opaque by the fact that it&#x27;s not clear what people
      see as the difference between unit and integration tests.

https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100b2/
This is a beta preview of Python 3.10
Python 3.10 is still in development. 3.10.0b2 is the second of four planned beta release previews. Beta release previews are intended to give the wider community the opportunity to test new features and bug fixes and to prepare their projects to support the new feature release.
We **strongly encourage** maintainers of third-party Python projects to **test with 3.10** during the beta phase and report issues found to [the Python bug tracker](https://bugs.python.org…</span>

surrounding the idea of increasing the performance of the CPython
interpreter.  At the 2021
Python Language Summit in mid-May, Guido van Rossum announced
that he and a small team are being funded by Microsoft to work with the
community on getting performance improvements upstream into the
interpreter—crucially, without breaking the C API so that the ecosystem of
Python extensions (e.g. NumPy) continue to
work.  Another talk at 
the summit looked
at Cinder, which is a performance-oriented CPython fork that is used in
production at Instagram.  Cinder was recently released as open-source
software, as was another
project to speed up CPython that originated at Dropbox: Pyston.</span>

                    <span>The seccomp()
mechanism allows a process to load a BPF program to restrict its future use
of system calls; it is a simple but flexible sandboxing mechanism that is
widely used.  Those filter programs, though, run on the &quot;classic&quot; BPF virtual
machine, rather than the extended BPF
(eBPF) machine used elsewhere in the 
kernel.  Moving seccomp() to eBPF has been an often-requested
change, but security concerns have prevented that from happening.  The
latest attempt to enable eBPF is this patch
set from YiFei Zhu; whether it will succeed where others have failed
remains to be seen.</span>

dynamic linking. One was Joe Nelson in considering how to make
libderp accessible on Windows, and the other was about w64devkit,
my Mingw-w64 distribution. I use these techniques so infrequently that I
need to figure it all out again each time I need it. Unfortunately there’s
a whole lot of outdated and incorrect information online which gets in the
way every time this happens. While it’s all fresh in my head, I will now
document what I know works.
In this article, all commands and examples are being run in the context of
w64devkit (1.7.0).

                    <span>From the earliest days, we used MSVC to compile the PVS-Studio C++ analyzer for Windows - then, in 2006, known as Viva64, version 1.00. With new releases, the analyzer&#x27;s C++ core learned to work on Linux and macOS, and we modified the project&#x27;s structure to support CMake. However, we kept using the MSVC compiler to build the analyzer&#x27;s version for Windows. Then, in 2019, on April 29th, Visual Studio developers announced they had included the LLVM utilities and Clang compiler in the IDE. And just recently we&#x27;ve gotten around to try it.</span>

                    <span>Modern computing systems can feature multiple types of memory that differ in
their performance characteristics.  The most common example is NUMA
architectures, where memory attached to the local node is faster to access
than memory on other nodes.  Recently, persistent memory has
started appearing in deployed systems as well; this type of memory is
byte-addressable like DRAM, but it is available in larger sizes and is slower to
access, especially for 
writes. This new memory type makes memory allocation even more complicated
for the kernel, driving the need for a method to better manage multiple types of
memory in one system.</span>

Tamta Kapanadze wishes that she had learned sooner about careers in technology. By the time that the Georgian citizen learned about them, she was already a university student. 
As Kapanadze continued her studies and her interest in technology grew, she wanted to spread the word about the growing field to high-school students in Georgia, a country where the industry is still small. 
To do this, Kapanadze called in the support of Google Developer Student Clubs (GDSCs), community groups for college and university students interested in Google&#x27;s developer technology. After Kapanadze graduated from university, she continued her work by organizing a chapter of Google Developer Groups (GDGs) for Kutaisi.…</span>

 A closer look at building a Flutter web app with Google Developer products
  
If you attended Google I/O this year, you probably stopped by the Google I/O photo booth for a selfie with our Google Developer mascots: Flutter’s Dash, Android Jetpack, Chrome’s Dino, and Firebase’s Sparky. If you didn’t, it’s not too late to jump in, take a selfie, and share it on social media! We loved seeing all of the pictures you posted and your favorite props! Want to learn more about building a camera plugin, layouts, and gestures used in a photo booth for Flutter on the web? 
 
 It took a combination of Google developer products to make the photo booth successful. The Flutter and Firebase teams joined forces to build a best in class example of Flutter on the web that used Firebase for hosting, auth, performance monitoring, and social sharing. Take a closer look at how the photo booth was built here and then grab the open source code on Github!

                    <span>2014년 7월 7일, 이스라엘과 팔레스타인 간 “50일 전쟁”이 있었다. 당시 팔레스타인 쪽에서는 2,143명의 사망자가, 이스라엘에서는 70명의 사망자가 나왔다. 특히 팔레스타인 사망자 중 약 1,460명이 민간인이고(이스라엘은 6명) 47만 명이 넘는 난민이 발생했다. 이 시기 우리나라에서는 이스라엘-팔레스타인 사이를 ‘전쟁’으로 보도하는 언론에 대한 비판(전쟁이 아니라 ‘사실상’ 일방적인 대학살이므로. -편집자)이 터져 나왔다.

                    <span>Over on the Python Software Foundation blog, the reports from day 1 of the Python Language Summit are available.  At the time of this writing, a few from day 2 are ready as well.  There are lots of interesting topics discussed at the summit, including a talk on making CPython faster from Python creator Guido van Rossum. &quot;Seven months ago, Guido van Rossum left a brief retirement to work at Microsoft. He was given the freedom to pick a project and decided to work on making CPython faster. Microsoft will be funding a small team consisting of Guido van Rossum, Mark Shannon, Eric Snow, and possibly others. [...] The team is optimistic about doubling CPython&#x27;s speed for 3.11. They plan to try an adaptive, specializing byte code interpreter, which is a bit like the existing inline cache and a bit like the shadow byte code covered in Dino Viehland&#x27;s talk.&quot;  Some of the ideas go back to Shannon&#x27;s thoughts on speeding up the interpreter that we looked at back in December.</span>

                    <span>When kernel developers want to communicate something about the state of a
running kernel, they tend to use printk(); that results in a log
entry that is intended — with varying success — to be human-readable.  As it
happens, though, the
consumers of that information are often not human; the kernel&#x27;s log output
is also read by automated monitoring systems that are looking for
problems.  The result is an impedance mismatch that often ends with the
monitoring system missing important messages.  The printk()
format indexing patch set is the latest of many attempts to improve
this situation.</span>

 What is the Mirru App?
 

 
Mirru is a free and open source Android app under development with which one can control robotic prosthetic hands via hand tracking. With our app, a user can instantly mirror grips from their sound hand onto a robotic one, which could be 3D-printed and self-assembled at low cost. With Mirru, we want to provide a cheap, intuitive and open end-to-end alternative to existing, costly, cumbersome and proprietary technology.

                    <span>Internet Relay
Chat (IRC) is a longstanding protocol—or series of protocols—for
creating online,
text-based chat rooms.
While many of the &quot;channels&quot; (as chat rooms are usually called) are highly useful to
a wide variety of projects and organizations, including much of the
free-software world,
IRC seems to have a community that suffers from
more than its fair share of disagreements, hostile forks, vitriol, and other types of
divisiveness.  It is perhaps no huge surprise, then, that the IRC
world is currently undergoing another of its periodic upheavals.  The
largest IRC network, freenode, is
embroiled in a messy dispute that has led
to the mass resignation
of many of its volunteer staff, the founding of a competitor network (run by the former staff),
and its abandonment by multiple high-profile projects.</span>

Google Developer Groups are one of the largest community networks of developers in the world. Every group has an organizer that helps curate events based on the interests of their local developer community.  
As we continue to explore how different Google Developer Groups build their communities, we interviewed Hebe He, an organizer of Google Developer Group Guangzhou in China. Learn more about how she is building the developer scene in China, thinking up new events for her community, and more below.

kernel&#x27;s memory-management subsystem that promises better performance for a
number of workloads; it was covered here in
April.  Since then, two new versions of that work have been released by

testing.  &quot;It&#x27;s been a very calm rc3 week, and at least in pure
number of commits this is the smallest rc3 we&#x27;ve had in the 5.x
series.

Considering that the merge window was not in any way small, this is a
bit surprising, but I suspect it&#x27;s one of those &#x27;not everybody sent in
fixes this week&#x27; things that will rectify itself next week.&quot;
This prepatch does include reverts and fixes for a long series of broken
patches identified in the TAB report on the UMN

                    <span>Among the many changes merged for the 5.13 kernel is support for the LLVM
control-flow integrity (CFI) mechanism.  CFI defends against exploits by
ensuring that indirect function calls have not been redirected by an
attacker.  Quite a bit of work was needed to make this feature work well
for the kernel, but the result appears to be production-ready and able to
defend Linux systems from a range of attacks.</span>

                    <span>The RISC-V CPU architecture has been
gaining prominence for some years; its relatively open nature makes it an
attractive platform on which a number of companies have built products.
Linux supports
RISC-V well, but there is one gaping hole: there is no support for
virtualization with KVM,
despite the fact that a high-quality 
implementation exists.  A recent attempt to add that support is shining
some light on a part of the ecosystem that, it seems, does not work quite
as well
as one would like.</span>

                    <span>Several readers have alerted us to some serious problems at freenode, which runs an IRC network that
is popular in the free-software world.  Evidently there has been a change
of control within the volunteer-run organization that has led to the
resignations of multiple different volunteers, at least in part due
to a concern about the personal information of freenode users under the new
management. &quot;The
freenode resignation FAQ&quot; has collected a bunch of information (and
links to even more resignation letters)…</span>

FAO에서 일하는 덴마크의 경제학자 에스터 보스럽은 역사적으로 인구가 증가할 때마다 사람들은 → 더 보기</span>
