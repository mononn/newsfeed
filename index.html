But what exactly is “new” and where is “here”? Great question. 
Emoji have long eclipsed their humble beginnings in sms text messages in the 1990’s. Today, they appear in places you&#x27;d never expect like self-checkout kiosks, television screens and yes, even refrigerators 😂. As emoji increase in popularity and advance in how they are used, the Noto Emoji project has stepped up our emoji game to help everyone get “🫠” without having to buy a new device (or a new refrigerator).

 At Google, we&#x27;re committed to making authentication safer and easier for our developers, so users can easily access the apps and websites they love. Google Identity Services (GIS) continues to advance and further develop our authentication solutions that offer immense value to our partner ecosystem, including highly requested features including a new verified phone number directly embedded in our authentication flows. 
For developers, our focus has always been to offer a frictionless experience that makes it easier for users to onboard and return to partner platforms, while also helping developers create a trusted relationship with their users.

What’s New
Today we are announcing a few new features that are now available across our libraries: …</span>

                              <span>OCI containers are the most popular type
of Linux container, but they are not the only type, nor were they the
first.  LXC (short for &quot;LinuX
Containers&quot;)  predates Docker by several years, though it was also not the
first.  LXC dates back to its first release in 2008; the earliest version of
Docker, which was tagged in 2013, was actually a wrapper around LXC.
The LXC project is still going strong and shows no signs of winding
down; LXC 5.0 was released in July and comes with a promise of support until
2027.</span>

3.3.0
The release process for 3.3.0 continued. José Armando García Sancio published the first release candidate on August 29. A few issues, including KAFKA-14187 and KAFKA-14156, were found during testing, so José built RC1 on September 1. The vote is currently ongoing. You can find the release plan in the wiki.
Kafka Improvement Proposals
Last month, the community submitted three Kafka Improvement Proposals (KIPs) (KIP-863 to KIP-865). I&#x27;ll highlight a couple of them:

Kevin Davin speaking at the SnowCamp Conference in 2019


Kevin Davin has always had a passion for learning and helping others learn, no matter their background or unique challenges they may face. He explains, “I want to learn something new every day, I want to help others learn, and I’m addicted to learning.” This mantra is evident in everything he does from giving talks at numerous conferences to helping people from underrepresented groups overcome imposter syndrome and even helping them become GDEs. In addition to learning, Kevin is also passionate about diversity and inclusion efforts, partly inspired by navigating the world with partial blindness.

                              <span>The idea of being able to write kernel code in the Rust language has a
certain appeal, but it is hard to judge how well that would actually work
in the absence of examples to look at.  Those examples, especially for
modules beyond the &quot;hello world&quot; level of complexity, have been somewhat
scarce, but that is beginning to change.  At the 2022 Kangrejos gathering
in Oviedo, Spain, two developers presented the modules they have developed
and some lessons that have been learned from this exercise.</span>

This release, 3.11.0rc2, is the last preview before the final release of Python 3.11.0 on 2022-10-24.
Entering the release candidate phase, only reviewed code changes which are clear bug fixes are allowed between this release candidate and the final release. The second candidate and the last planned release preview is currently planned for Monday, 2022-09-05 while the official release is planned for Monday, 2022-10-24.
There will be no ABI changes from this point forward in the 3.11 series and the goal is that there will be as few code changes as possible.

                              <span>Sometimes, If you mix different integer types in an expression, you might end up with tricky cases. For example, comparing long with size_t might give different results than long with unsigned short. C++20 brings some help, and there’s no need to learn all the complex rules :)



     
    


Let’s have a look at two comparisons:
#include 

int main() {
    long a &#x3D; -100;
    unsigned short b &#x3D; 100;
    std::cout &lt;&lt; (a &lt; b);   // 1
    size_t c &#x3D; 100;
    std::cout &lt;&lt; (a &lt; c);   // 2
}   


If you run the code @Compiler Explorer (GCC 12, x86-64, default flags) you’ll see:
10


Why? Why not 11?
(By the way, I asked that question on Twitter, see https://twitter.com/fenbf/status/1568566458333990914 - thank you for all the answers and hints)

                              <span>While the Rust language has appeal for kernel development, many developers are
concerned by the fact that there is only one compiler available; there are
many reasons why a second implementation would be desirable.  At the 2022
Kangrejos gathering, three developers
described projects to build Rust 
programs with GCC in two different ways.  A fully featured, GCC-based Rust
implementation is still going to take some time, but rapid progress is
being made.</span>

                              <span>Huge pages are a mechanism implemented by the CPU that allows the management
of memory in larger chunks.  Use of huge pages can increase performance
significantly, which is why the kernel has a &quot;transparent huge page&quot;
mechanism to try to create them when possible.  But a huge page will only
be helpful if most of the memory contained within it is actually in use;
otherwise it is just an expensive waste of memory.  This patch
set from Alexander Zhu implements a mechanism to detect underutilized
huge pages and recover that wasted memory for other uses.</span>

이런 경우에 사용되는 도구가 frida-ios-dump이다.
https://github.com/AloneMonkey/frida-ios-dump

사전 준비 
이 글에서는 사전준비가 미리 되어있다고 가정하겠다. 필요한 부분은 이전 블로그 게시글을 확인하면 좋다.
- 탈옥한 iphone : https://cpuu.postype.com/post/10436260
- frida 도구 설치 방법 : https://cpuu.postype.com/post/10415747


Frida-ios-dump 설치
% git clone https://github.com/AloneMonkey/frida-ios-dump.git
% cd frida-ios-dump/
% pip3 install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
설치가 완료되면 dump.py 파일이 존재하는데, 여기에서 아래의 정보를 알맞게 입력해야 한다.
User &#x3D; &#x27;root&#x27;
Password &#x3D; &#x27;alpine&#x27;
Host &#x3D; &#x27;IP주소&#x27;
Port &#x3D; 22
탈옥된 아이폰이 root 계정 비밀번호가 alpine 이라고 할 때, 동일한 네트워크라면 192 또는 172로 시작하는 주소를 찾아서 입력하면 되고, ssh port 도 기본은 22 이지만 필요한 경우 알맞게 변경하면 된다.


애플리케이션 추출
dump 파이썬 스크립트에서 -l 옵션을 이용한다.
또는 frida-ps 를 사용해도 같다.


이렇게 확인된 Identifier 값을 입력하면 된다. 참고로 덤프를 할 때 해당 디바이스는 화면 잠금이 해제된 상태여야만 작업이 진행된다.


추출된 IPA 파일은 사실상 압축된 형태의 내용으로, unzip 명령어를 사용하면 해제가 가능하다.
% unzip unc0ver.ipa
디렉토리 내부에 보면 arm64 형식의 Mach-O 바이너리 파일을 획득할 수 있다.
% file unc0ver
unc0ver: Mach-O 64-bit executable arm64
리버스 엔지니어링을 하면 된다.

 A medical game for doctors, a language game for kids, a scary game for horror lovers and an escape room game for thrill seekers! In this latest batch of #WeArePlay stories, we’re celebrating the founders behind a wonderful variety of games from all over the world. Have a read and get gaming! 

To start, let’s meet Sam from Chicago. Coming from a family of doctors, his Dad challenged him to make a game to help those in the medical field. Sam agreed, made a game and months later discovered over 100,000 doctors were able to practice medical procedures. This early success inspired him to found Level Ex - a company of 135, making world-class medical games for doctors across the globe. Despite his achievements, his Dad still hopes Sam may one day get into medicine himself and clinch a Nobel prize.   




Next, a few more stories from around the world:

Aldo and Sandro from Peru - founders of Dark Dome. They combine storytelling and art to make thrilling and chilling games, filled with plot twists and jump scares.






Vladimir, Tomislav and Boris from Croatia - founders of Pine Studio. They won the Indie Games Festival 2021 with their game Cats In Time. 





Kelly, Mikk, Reimo and Madde from Estonia - founders of ALPA kids. Their language games for children have a huge impact on early education and language preservation.

                              <span>Starting a Python application typically results in a flurry of imports as
modules from various locations (and the modules they import) get added
into the application process.  All of that occurs before the application
even gets started doing whatever it is the user actually launched it for;
that delay can be significant—and annoying.  Beyond that, many of those
imports may not be necessary at all for the code path being followed, so
eagerly doing the import is purely wasted time.  A proposal back in May
would add a way for applications to choose lazy imports, where the import
is deferred until the module is actually used.</span>

                              <span>We have some security content, and plenty of regular bug fixes for 3.10. Let’s dive right in.


CVE-2020-10735
Converting between int and str in bases other than 2 (binary), 4, 8 (octal), 16 (hexadecimal), or 32 such as base 10 (decimal) now raises a ValueError if the number of digits in string form is above a limit to avoid potential denial of service attacks due to the algorithmic complexity.
Security releases for 3.9.14, 3.8.14, and 3.7.14 are made available simultaneously to address this issue, along with some less urgent security content.
Upgrading your installations is highly recommended.

When adopting GitOps, organizations must plan carefully to divide tasks and configuration files appropriately between repositories and directories in each repository. Standard practices have long existed for using Git-based workflows for infrastructure and software delivery. But with the dawn of cloud-native architectures and Kubernetes, you can now automate a wide range of deployments based on declarations stored in a Git repository.
The question of best practices comes up a lot when creating repositories for GitOps. There is no magic bullet, but several common patterns exist to match the various ways the organization interacts internally.

on July 31.  There are no real headline-grabbing features that come
with the new release, as the project generally seeks to make incremental
changes, rather than larger, potentially disruptive ones.
Changes in this release include a new Bluetooth manager that brings several
improvements,  driverless printing and scanning
by default, a process monitor to inform the user
about resource-intensive background tasks, new functionality for the
Timeshift system backup tool, and several major under-the-hood improvements
to the Cinnamon 
desktop environment.</span>

      then network latency and the request processing time (including
      serialization, deserialization of the request on the server side) can add
      significant overhead. Unmesh Joshi shows how requests can

In August, we published tutorials to help you improve the observability of your microservices, build security into your Node.js development process, easily containerize .NET applications, and more. Let&#x27;s dive into the August highlights.

Part 1: 3 essentials for writing a Linux system library in Rust


Part 2: How to create C binding for a Rust library


Part 3: How to create Python binding for a Rust library



This article will demonstrate how to build trust in a Continuous Integration (CI) system for your Rust library.
You can download the demo code from its GitHub repository.
The package contains:
An echo server listening on the Unix socket /tmp/librabc
A Rust crate that connects to the socket and sends a ping packet every 2
seconds
A C/Python binding
A command-line interface (CLI) for the client
The CI system of this GitHub repository is built on Gith…</span>

우선 실험환경은 Apple Silicon 버전의 일명 M1 macmini 이고 macOS Monterey(12.5) 운영체제 환경이다.


개발 환경 구축
기본적으로 컴파일 및 여러가지 진행을 위해 터미널에서 아래의 명령어로 관련 도구를 설치한다.
% xcode-select --install
명령어를 입력하면 화면에 위와 같은 메시지가 뜨고, 설치를 눌러 진행한다.


설치 완료후 아래와 같이 현재 도구 버전을 확인해볼 수 있다.
% xcode-select --version
xcode-select version 2395. 
% gcc --version          
Apple clang version 13.1.6 (clang-1316.0.21.2.5)

                              <span>The kernel is, in many ways, a marvel of scalability, but there is a
longstanding pain point in the memory-management subsystem that has
resisted all attempts at elimination: the mmap_lock.  This lock
was inevitably a topic at the 2022 Linux
Storage, Filesystem, Memory-Management and BPF Summit (LSFMM), where the idea of

an implementation of that idea — but with an interesting twist on how
those locks are implemented.</span>

This third installment demonstrates how to create Python bindings so that Python projects can use your Rust library.
You can download the demo code from its GitHub repository. The package contains:
An echo server listening on the Unix socket /tmp/librabc
A Rust crate that connects to the socket and sends a ping packet every 2 seconds
A C/Python binding

                              <span>This article is the second installment of a series about how to take advantage of the recent Rust support added to Linux. The first article in the series, 3 essentials for writing a Linux system library in Rust, describes special considerations that system libraries require when you are writing in Rust. This article demonstrates how to create a C binding so that programmers in C or C++ can call your Rust library. Rust has not conquered the Linux world yet, so our system library needs to provide bindings to other languages.
Check out the other three articles in this series:

                              <span>Peter Eckersley, one of the original founders of the Let&#x27;s Encrypt non-profit TLS certificate authority, has died suddenly, as reported by Seth Schoen:

Peter was the leader of EFF&#x27;s contributions to Let&#x27;s Encrypt and ACME over the course of several years during which these technologies turned from a wild idea into an important part of Internet infrastructure. He also took a lot of initiative in coalescing the EFF, Mozilla, and University of Michigan teams into a single team and a single project. He later served on the initial board of directors of the Internet Security Research Group.
[...]
Toward the end of his life, Peter focused his career on ethics and safety of artificial intelligence, and he founded the AI Objectives Institute to examine the concrete parallels he saw between surprising and undesirable outcomes that can emerge within economies and those that can emerge in machine learning systems.


More about Eckersley can be found at his web site, on his Wikipedia page, and in a Hacker News discussion.</span>

just been released and proclaimed ready for production use.


	When we defined our set of milestones, we defined Arti 1.0.0 as
	&quot;ready for production use&quot;: You should be able to use it in the
	real world, to get a similar degree of privacy, usability, and
	stability to what you would with a C client Tor. The APIs should be
	(more or less) stable for embedders.

	We believe we have achieved this. You can now use arti
	proxy to 
	connect to the Tor network to anonymize your network connections.</span>

system-call interface and the wrappers for that interface provided by the C

in a discussion that has been playing out over the course of the last year
on whether to use C standard type names to describe kernel-defined

is an attempt to replace various ad hoc implementations with a
single framework, and to add some new applications as well.</span>

                              <span>In this article, I will present options for building containers that will run in Kubernetes and Red Hat OpenShift. There are many reasons against development in the environment that will ultimately run the container, such as cost, speed, tooling, and so on. Creating a container that works on your PC requires a local development environment that gives you the complete experience of coding, building, debugging, and running—and then pushes all pieces of the container to a host or cloud service. The best way to describe this process is tantamount to encapsulating your entire software building experience into one file and then sending it off to a server.
Container development offers a new way of thinking about software development. It is an application development model in which you decide whic…</span>

                              <span>Rust is a good choice for writing a Linux
system library due to guarantees on memory and thread safety, a revolutionary approach to memory ownership, and a polished Foreign Function Interface. In spite of a slightly steep learning curve, you will come to love Rust and especially its compiler.
This article is the first in a series focusing on Rust for Linux. Check out the other three articles:

                              <span>A fairly lengthy discussion of whether there should be a way to
break out of (or 
continue) more than one level of nested loops in Python recently
took place in the Ideas
category of the language&#x27;s discussion forum.  The idea is
attractive, at least in an abstract sense—some other languages support
jumping out of 
multiple loops at once—but it seems unlikely to go anywhere for Python.
The barrier to new features is fairly high, for sure, but there is also a
need for proponents to provide real-world examples that demonstrate their
advantages.  That, too, is a difficult bar to clear, as was seen in the
discussion.</span>

                              <span>The GitHub blog series on how the Git database works continues with this
look at file-history queries.


	If these history modes usually have the same output, then why
	wouldn’t we always use --full-history
	--simplify-merges? The reason is performance. Not only
	does simplified history speed up the query by skipping a large
	portion of commits, it also allows iterative output. The simplified
	history can output portions of the history without walking the
	entire history. By contrast, the --simplify-merges algorithm is
	defined recursively starting at commits with no parents. Git cannot
	output a single result until walking all reachable commits and
	computing their diffs on the input path. This can be extremely slow
	for large repositories.</span>

He wants to understand what these new hotspots do […]

                              <span>Dealing with the non-free firmware that is increasingly needed to install
Debian has been a hot topic for the
distribution over the past few months.  The problem goes back further 
still, of course, but Steve McIntyre re-raised the 
issue in April, which resulted in a predictable lengthy discussion
thread on the debian-devel mailing list.  Now McIntyre has proposed a
general resolution (GR) with the intent of resolving how to give users a way to
install the distribution on their hardware while trying to avoid trampling
on the 
&quot;100% free&quot; guarantee in the Debian Social
Contract.  Finding the right balance is going to be tricky as is shown
by the multiple GR 
options that have been proposed in the discussion.</span>

                              <span>Sourceware.org has long hosted the
repositories for many important free-software projects, including much of
the GNU toolchain.  Frank Ch. Eigler has posted
about some changes coming to Sourceware:


	Red Hat has been and continues to be a generous sponsor of the
	hardware, connectivity, and the very modest employee time it
	requires.  We are glad to report there are zero indications of any
	change to this commitment.  Things are stable, new services are
	coming online, and users seem to be happy.  However, it is always
	good to think about any future needs.

	To protect confidence in the long term future of this hosting
	service, we have reached out to the Software Freedom Conservancy
	(SFC) to function as a &quot;fiscal sponsor&quot;.</span>

detailed look at how Git stores the commit history to be able to
quickly answer queries.


	The commit-graph file provides a location for adding new
	information to our commits that do not exist in the commit object
	format by default. The new information that we store is called a
	generation number. There are multiple ways to compute a
	generation number, but the most important property we need to
	guarantee is the following:

	If the generation number of a commit A is less than the generation
	number of a commit B, then A cannot reach B.</span>

Today only 1% of venture capital goes to Black founders in the US, with Black women founders receiving even less. At Google, we are committed to building racial equity in the North American startup ecosystem. In May, we announced an open call for applications for our third class of Google for Startups Accelerator: Black Founders, bringing the best of Google&#x27;s programs, products, people and technology to Black founders across North America. From hundreds of applicants, we&#x27;re proud to announce the 12 exceptional startups selected to join the accelerator:

That means multiple applications—microservices—running within a managed environment. Kubernetes, an open source container orchestration platform, is just such an environment, and by far the most popular one at that. Let&#x27;s consider it from a developer&#x27;s perspective.
Run multiple containers on Kubernetes
Running a container with Docker or Podman is great, but it&#x27;s only a start. To implement an entire system, you need several services (or microservices, if you will). Kubernetes can orchestrate the entire system in a namespace, giving you both isolation from other namespaces and a shared environment within a namespace. You can just plop your applications i…</span>

                              <span>I’ve  always commented that the way to get an interface working is to lock
the engineers responsible for each side of the interface together in a room
until it works.  I like to say it in jest, but in many ways there’s a lot of
truth to it.
One of the challenges of working with Open Source anything really is debugging.
To be successful, an open source engineer needs to commit their time to
supporting their design–no matter how it is used.  As an illustration, what
happens when one engineer uses an open source design, uses it inappropriately,
and then declares that it doesn’t work?  It can reflect poorly on the quality
of the design–even if the design was and remains fully functional.
As an example, someone recently attempted to use my digital
PLL.  They commented
that the PLL
worked great,…</span>

entered the kernel during the 6.0 merge window.  This subsystem, called

user-space drivers, resulting in some impressive performance numbers.  Ublk
has a lot of interesting potential, but the current use cases for it are
not entirely clear.  The recently posted crash-recovery
mechanism for ublk makes it clear, though, that those use cases do
exist.</span>

Google Earth Engine GDE Liza Goldberg uses tech to fight climate change
Liza Goldberg learned to code through Google Earth Engine at age fourteen, when her mentors at NASA, where she was an intern, introduced the tool as a way to model global trends in environmental change. Liza, who had arrived at NASA with no coding or remote sensing experience, gradually gained expertise in the platform, thanks to strong mentorship, Google training, and guidance from the Google Earth Engine developer community. The fact that Google Earth Engine is built for scientists and has a clear world impact aligned with Liza’s commitment to using technology to combat climate change.  “Earth Engine enabled me t…</span>

                              <span>Containers, Kubernetes, and microservices have been a hot topic for the past few years, yet many developers may still be wondering how they all work. To take a somewhat different angle on the subject, this article will describe how a container image is constructed and executed using a non-traditional, conversational approach.
First, let&#x27;s take a quick look at the layers of a container image and how they relate to one another.
What is a container image?
Briefly, an image is an operating system that runs libraries and runtimes and an application, all enclosed in an Open Container Initiative (OCI) compliant file.
Figure 1 illustrates an example: a Node.js application that uses the Express library, running on the Red Hat Universal Base Image (UBI) operating system. If you&#x27;re not familiar with …</span>

                              <span>C++ is famous… or infamous for its complex initialization syntax. In this article, I’ll show you around 20 ways to initialize simple std::string variables. Can we somehow make it easier to understand?



     
    


Have a look:
void foo() {
    std::string str0;
    std::string str1 {};
}


We have two local variables (with automatic storage duration), str0 is default initialized, while str1 is value initialized.
While default initialization is unsafe for integers or other built-in types, it’s relatively fine (but less readable) for class types with a default constructor. In that case, a default constructor will be called, and the string object will get an empty value. The same constructor is invoked for value initialization.
Nevertheless, it’s best to set a value:
void foo() {

                              <span>Filesystems maintain a lot of metadata about the files they hold; most of
this metadata is for consumption by user space.  Some metadata, though,
stays buried within the filesystem and is not visible outside of the
kernel.  Once such 
piece of metadata is the file version count, known as i_version.
Current efforts to change how i_version is managed — and to make
it visible to user space — have engendered a debate on what
i_version actually means and what its behavior should be.</span>

Fighting Counterfeit Currency in Northern Pakistan with Technology

Counterfeit currency remains a significant issue in smaller and remote towns of Pakistan, such as the Gilgit Baltistan region of Northern Pakistan. Ahsan Aman, a Google Developer Student Clubs (GDSC) Lead at COMSATS Wah University in Islamabad, grew up in a small town in the region and watched citizens and shopkeepers become victims of counterfeiting. 
Counterfeiting is defined as the act of imitating something authentic, with the intent to steal, destroy, or replace the original, for use in illegal transactions, or otherwise with the intent to deceive individuals into believing that the fake is of equal or gr…</span>

We recently spoke with Ceren Tunay, a Google Developer Group Organizer in Edirne, Turkey.   who notes, “while we were organizing events, I noticed people have a huge passion for tech. I asked myself, &quot;what is that thing in tech that makes people so impassioned? And after that, I started to better understand the tech industry, thanks to the programs offered by Google Developer Groups. Then I decided to learn to code. After a while, now I know that I am where I want to be, and realized I have worked towards finding my dream job.”

                              <span>With all of the complex problems that must be solved in the kernel, one
might think that copying a string would draw little attention.  Even with
the hazards that C strings present, simply moving some bytes should not be
all that hard.  But string-copy functions have been a frequent subject of
debate over the years, with different variants being in fashion at times.
Now it seems that the BSD-derived strlcpy() function
may finally be on its way out of the kernel.</span>

      Partition provides a good way to distribute data over many nodes when
      clients are accessing a single key at a time. If, however, a client wants
      a range of values, such as all names from &quot;a&quot; to &quot;f&quot;, then they&#x27;ll need to
      access every node. Unmesh Joshi explains how a

                              <span>The just-in-time (JIT) compiler in OpenJDK improves Java performance through a number of optimizations, particularly in loops. Until recently, many optimizations worked only when the loop index was an int variable. This article shows how the HotSpot virtual machine was upgraded to add the same optimizations for long variables. The article covers particularly out-of-bounds checking (also called range checks).
Why optimization was added for long variables
One of the important promises of Java, along with many other modern languages, is to catch out-of-bounds errors, such as when you mistakenly end a loop at array.length instead of at array.length-1. The HotSpot virtual machine eliminates range checks when possible as a performance optimization. As discussed in a previous article, the JIT com…</span>

                              <span>Discussion on PEP 671 (&quot;Syntax
for late-bound function argument defaults&quot;) has been going on—in fits and
starts—since it was introduced last
October. The idea is to provide a way 
to specify the default for a function argument that is evaluated in the
scope of the function 
call, which will allow more concise, and visible, defaults.  But there has
been a persistent complaint that what the
language needs is a more-general 
deferred computation feature; late-bound defaults would simply fall out as
one specific user of the feature.   The arrival of a proposal for deferred
computation did not really 
accomplish that goal, however.</span>

The challenges faced by women founders is evident. Despite an increase in total venture funding raised by women-led startups in recent years, women founders still secured only 2% of the total amount invested in VC-backed startups throughout the year. In addition, a recent report on women-founded companies in Canada noticed that women technology entrepreneurs travel longer routes from startup to scale-up, with women in the study doing more funding pitches than men and taking longer to raise their Series A financing.
In 2020, we launched Google for Startups Accelerator: Women Founders to help bridge the gender gap in the North American startup ecosystem, and provide high-quality mentorship opportunities, technical gu…</span>

Before package management became commonplace, installing applications was a tedious, error-prone undertaking. The ease a package manager brings to installing an application on a Linux computer has been a major factor contributing to the widespread adoption of Linux as a mainstream operating system for both business and home users.
Package management under Linux is divided, however. Two major systems co-exist:
The APT package management system for Debian and its many derivatives, notably Ubuntu. Packages are marked with the .deb suffix and are managed through the apt command-line interface (CLI).

Let me back up and set the stage a bit more.  I’m working with what will be
an underwater design, as shown in Fig. 1.
Fig 1. Controlling an Underwater FPGA



For those who haven’t figured it out, this will (eventually) form the basis of
a SONAR device.
At first, this problem seems simple enough: there will be an FPGA device
controlled via a network port.  Easy, got it.  Better yet, what’s the easiest
network protocol to use?
TCP.  Open
Source TCP,
software stacks aren’t all that hard to write, and I know there are several
open source stacks that are easy enough to use.  (No, I’ve never written one
myself …)
But, let’s dig a little deeper: I want to be able to control and debug the

via the same network port.  That means I’ll want to …</span>

                              <span>Docker and other container
engines can greatly simplify many aspects of deploying a server-side
application, but numerous applications consist of more than one container.
Managing a group of containers only gets harder as additional applications
and services are deployed; this has led to the development of a class of
tools called container orchestrators.  The best-known of these by far is Kubernetes; the history of container
orchestration can 
be divided into what came before it and what came after.</span>

                              <span>The Electronic Frontier Foundation has announced that it is representing cryptography professor Matthew Green, who has chosen to republish the sanctioned Tornado Cash open-source code as a GitHub repository. 

EFF’s most central concern about OFAC’s [US Office of Foreign Assets Control] actions arose because, after the SDN [Specially Designated Nationals] listing of “Tornado Cash,” GitHub took down the canonical repository of the Tornado Cash source code, along with the accounts of the primary developers, including all their code contributions. While GitHub has its own right to decide what goes on its platform, the disappearance of this source code from GitHub after the government action raised the specter of government action chilling the publication of this code.  

In keeping with our longstanding defense of the right to publish code, we are representing Professor Matthew Green, who teaches computer science at the Johns Hopkins Information Security Institute, including applied cryptography and anonymous cryptocurrencies. Part of his work involves studying and improving privacy-enhancing technologies, and teaching his students about mixers like Tornado Cash. The disappearance of Tornado Cash’s repository from GitHub created a gap in the available information on mixer technology, so Professor Green made a fork of the code, and posted the replica so it would be available for study. The First Amendment protects both GitHub’s right to host that code, and Professor Green’s right to publish (here republish) it on GitHub so he and others can use it for teaching, for further study, and for development of the technology.</span>

This article demonstrates how to monitor 3scale API Management using Prometheus to collect statistics and Grafana to display them. We use the monitoring provided by the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
The OpenShift Container Platform uses plugins installed from OperatorHub for monitoring. This article also demonstrates how to install the Grafana Operator. You don&#x27;t have to install the Prometheus Operator because it is already installed in OpenShift monitoring, and the Prometheus user interface (UI) is integrated into the Monitoring page of the OpenShift console.

This article addresses the added complexity of observability—seeing what&#x27;s going on within your application and its resources. We will also cover how to set up OpenTelemetry to achieve this visibility. This is useful when resource usage wanders outside of the expected norms.
The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) maintains a set of open source libraries and tools for visibility. OpenTelemetry is gaining momentum with developers to increase the observability of their Node.js applications through cross-component traces.

subsystem, which entered the 
kernel during the 5.15 release cycle, uses various heuristics to determine
which pages of memory are in active use.  Since the beginning, the intent
has been to use this information to influence memory management.  The 6.0
kernel contains another step in this direction, giving DAMON the ability to
actively reorder pages on the kernel&#x27;s least-recently-used (LRU) lists.</span>

                              <span>In a previous article, I described how to create a SaaS platform in a Kubernetes cluster. This article takes a detailed look inside the demonstration project that accompanied that earlier article. The demonstration project is the code base shared by all tenants using the SaaS platform. This article describes the structure of the demonstration application. You&#x27;ll also see how to get the code up and running for multiple containerized tenants in a Kubernetes cluster, and how to expose the service to clients.
A key aspect of SaaS architecture is a generic code base used by all tenants running in the Kubernetes cluster. The application logic used by each tenant is encapsulated in a Linux container image that&#x27;s declared within the definition of the tenant&#x27;s Kubernetes deployment. We&#x27;ll see multi…</span>

preserving ABI compatibility than others; the GNU C Library (glibc) project 
stands out even among those that put a lot of effort into preserving

So it may be a bit surprising that a recent glibc change is being
blamed for breaking a number of applications, most of which are proprietary
games.  There is, it seems, a class of glibc changes that can break
applications, but which are not deemed to be ABI changes.</span>

                              <span>Peer-to-peer systems treat each cluster node as equal; there is no
      strict leader. This means there is no explicit leader election process as
      happens in the Leader and Followers pattern. However, there still needs to
      be one cluster node acting as cluster coordinator for tasks such as
      assigning data partitions to other cluster nodes and tracking when new
      cluster nodes join or fail and take corrective actions. Unmesh
      Joshi explains how this is resolved with an Emergent

                              <span>There was a time when care had to be taking when buying hardware if the
goal was to run Linux on it.  The situation has improved considerably in
recent decades, and unsupported hardware is more the exception than the
rule.  That has, for many years, been especially true of Intel hardware;
that company has made a point of ensuring that its offerings work with
Linux.  So it is a bit surprising that the IPU6 image processor shipped
with Alder Lake CPUs
lacks support in Linux, and is unlikely to get it anytime soon.  The
problem highlighted here goes beyond just Intel, though.</span>

                              <span>The goal of the Drogue IoT project is to make it easy to connect devices to cloud-based applications. This article will demonstrate how to implement firmware in Rust based on Drogue&#x27;s device support. This way, a device can communicate with the cloud using the low power LoRaWAN protocol. We will also illustrate how Node.js handles the server side.
The purpose of Drogue IoT
Many open source technologies already exist in the realm of messaging and the Internet of Things ( IoT). However, technologies change over time, and not everything that exists now is fit for the world of tomorrow. For instance, C and C++ still have issues with memory safety. The concepts of cloud native, serverless, and pods might also need a different approach to designing cloud-side applications. Drogue IoT aims to help…</span>

company can interact with Tornado Cash in any way, all assets of the
organization are to be reported so that they can be seized, and more.  But
at the core of Tornado Cash is a chunk of open-source code for &quot;smart contracts&quot;

Our celebration of app and game businesses continues with more #WeArePlay stories. Today, we’re starting with George from Bristol, UK - a young entrepreneur taking the streetwear industry by storm. 
After spending hours and hours searching for the latest styles in sneakers and streetwear, George realised there’s a market in helping fellow enthusiasts find the latest drops. At just 16 years old, he took it upon himself to learn to code and created his app, Droplist. It points people to upcoming special collections from major labels around the world. Find out more about his story.



Today we also spotlight few more stories from around the world:

Anica and Kristijan from an island in Croatia - founders of Dub Studio Productions to help music lovers around the global turn up the bass or lower the treble on their favourite songs.




Robert from Wyoming, founder of Bluebird Languages - language learning apps with over 6 million hours of audio lessons spanning 164 languages, from Hungarian to Haitian Creole. 



And one more new story - because why not! This time, featuring Annabel from Kenya. After struggling to find a mechanic when stuck on the roadside in Nairobi, she and her co-founder created Ziada to help people find local service providers.

      Distributed Systems. In this first of a new batch, he looks at the
      difficulty of getting consistent reads from servers in the presence of the
      inevitable drifts between system logs. A Clock-Bound Wait
      adds a small wait time on a request for a value at a recent time. This way

                              <span>This article demonstrates how to deploy Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (JBoss EAP) on Microsoft Azure using Ansible automation. Currently, Red Hat has a Microsoft Azure Marketplace offering of JBoss EAP, but it&#x27;s available only through the Bring-Your-Own-Subscription (BYOS) model, which is relatively complex. This article creates Azure resources using Ansible Collections for Azure and then deploys JBoss EAP using the WildFly service provided by the Ansible Middleware project.
Deploy JBoss EAP in 6 easy steps
We will use azure-eap-demo as the sample application for this article. Using this application, we will automate and deploy JBoss EAP instances on Azure virtual machines running Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

                              <span>The last update on LLVM relicensing was done about 8 monthsago. Since thenwe’ve made substantial progress, so I thought it’s worthwhile to share anotherupdate.
The TL;DR is:

Out of the about 32 million LOC that were contributed under the old license,we’ve reduced the lines of code that aren’t relicensed yet from 6% to only2%.
8 months ago, we were still searching for ways to contact 808 individuals whocontributed to LLVM over the past 20 years. We managed to reduce that numberto 421 individuals now.
We’ve also reduced the number of companies or universities to get a relicensingagreement from from 133 to 122.

Read on to find out how we achieved that great progress and how you can helpwith getting us closer to our end goal of having LLVM fully relicensed.

                              <span>Back in November, we looked at a Python proposal
to have function arguments with defaults that get
evaluated when the function is called, rather than when it is defined.
The article suggested that the discussion surrounding the proposal was
likely to continue on for a ways—which it did—but it had died down by the
end of last year.  That all changed in mid-June, when the already voluminous
discussion of the feature picked up again; once again, some people thought that
applying the idea only to function arguments was too restrictive.  Instead,
a more general mechanism to defer evaluation was touted as something that
could work for late-bound arguments while being useful for other use cases as
well.</span>

                              <span>If you use open source projects from GitHub or GitLab in your infrastructure, you have probably established workflows to create project builds that you can install. You might create builds regularly and execute them in a similar manner across projects. Let&#x27;s say you want to build the code changes in Fedora Linux or CentOS Stream for each commit, release, or pull request in these projects. Packit can automate this policy, fold into a CI/CD pipeline, and do even more.
Packit is an open source project that tests and builds RPM packages on Fedora Linux, CentOS Stream, and other distributions to ease the integration of upstream projects with the distributions.
This article focuses on Packit Service, which operates on GitHub and GitLab. You can also install a command line interface (CLI) locally…</span>

Introduction and background
  
The most recent Serverless Migration Station video demonstrated how to add use of the App Engine&#x27;s Blobstore service to a sample Python 2 App Engine app, kicking off the first of a 2-part series on migrating away from Blobstore. In today&#x27;s Module 16 video, we complete this journey, arriving at Cloud Storage. Moving away from proprietary App Engine services like Blobstore makes apps more portable, giving them enough flexibility to: 

 Update to more recent language releases, say from Python 2 to 3 or Java 8 to 17, and run on App Engine&#x27;s 2nd generation service 
Shift across to other serverless platforms, like Cloud Functions or Cloud Run (with or without Docker), or  
Move to VM-based serv…</span>

in the Android Open Source Project; the list of changes is long.

6.0-rc1 and closed the merge window on
August 14, as expected; by then, 13,543 non-merge changesets
had found their way into the mainline repository.  Just over half of those
were pulled after our first 6.0 merge-window
summary was written.  The latter part of the merge window tends to be
more focused on fixes than new features, but there were still a number of
interesting changes added during this time.</span>
