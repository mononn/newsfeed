                              <span>Tooling for profiling the effects of memory usage and layout has always
lagged behind that for profiling processor activity, so Namhyung Kim&#x27;s patch set for data-type profiling
in perf is a welcome addition.  It provides aggregated breakdowns of
memory accesses by data type that can inform structure layout and access
pattern changes.  Existing tools have either, like heaptrack, focused on
profiling allocations, or, like perf mem, on accounting memory
accesses only at the address level.  This new work builds on the latter,
using DWARF debugging information to correlate memory operations with their
source-level types.</span>

                              <span>The Rust Blog announces
the stabilization of a couple of trait features aimed at improving support
for async code:


	Ever since the stabilization of RFC #1522 in Rust 1.26, Rust has
	allowed users to write impl Trait as the return type of
	functions (often called &quot;RPIT&quot;). This means that the function
	returns &quot;some type that implements Trait&quot;. This is
	commonly used to return closures, iterators, and other types that
	are complex or impossible to write explicitly. [...]

	Starting in Rust 1.75, you can use return-position impl
	Trait in trait (RPITIT) definitions and in trait impls. For
	example, you could use this to write a trait method that returns an
	iterator: [...]

	So what does all of this have to do with async functions? Well,
	async functions are &quot;just sugar&quot; for functions that return
	-&gt; impl Future. Since these are now permitted in
	traits, we also permit you to write traits that use async fn.</span>

Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:
WSL 2
Installed RHEL on WSL
Launch the RHEL distro on WSL
This article assumes that you have successfully installed the WSL CLI on your machine, obtained the RHEL image from the hybrid cloud, and imported the RHEL image into WSL.

First, we&#x27;ll use Ansible to install JBoss Web Server 5.7 on the target system and then we&#x27;ll use another playbook to perform the migration, thus ensuring that the target JBoss Web Server instance has been upgraded successfully.
Prerequisites
To support this demonstration you will first need to have a working Ansible environment. This involves having Ansible installed on the local (control) machine and one or several target hosts. As we are using the certified Ansible collection provided by Red Hat, Ansible needs to be configured to use Red Hat Ansible automation hub to retrieve content.

                              <span>A new infrastructure has been added to GCC optimizers over the past few years. This was nominally in support of Ranger, the new range generation engine that I have been working on. The primary goal is to modernize the code base and provide flexible usage options throughout the rest of the compiler.
One of the major changes was moving to an on-demand model for calculating ranges. Traditionally range information was created by the VRP (Value Range Propagation) pass and some basic global information was then made available outside this pass. The more accurate context sensitive ranges were only available within the pass. There were some attempts to integrate the old VRPs mechanisms into other passes, but these were awkward and ultimately unsatisfactory.
Ranger however can be enabled in any pas…</span>

                              <span>Linux graphics developers often speak of modern Linux graphics
when they refer to  a number of individual software components and how they
interact 
with each other.
Among other things, it&#x27;s a mix of kernel-managed display resources, 
Wayland for compositing, accelerated 3D rendering, and decidedly not X11.
In a two-part series, we will take a fast-paced journey
through the graphics code to see how it converts application data
to pixel data and displays it on the screen. In this installment, we look
at application rendering, Mesa internals, and the
necessary kernel features.</span>

9.6 has been released.  It includes some minor improvements and a fix
for the so-called Terrapin
attack.


	While cryptographically novel, the security impact of this attack
   is fortunately very limited as it only allows deletion of
   consecutive messages, and deleting most messages at this stage of
   the protocol prevents user authentication from proceeding and
   results in a stuck connection.</span>

                              <span>The post discusses the use of continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines in embedded system testing. It presents a case study on an embedded project, where the author applies automated testing using CTest, Unity testing framework, and CMake, a software building tool, to ensure the project&#x27;s robustness. The post also exhibits the usage of JRun tool for execution on the hardware and provides detailed instructions on adding and running tests either manually or through Visual Studio Code. It suggests that following this approach would facilitate a modern environment for hardware testing in embedded systems. Continue reading →</span>

                              <span>The NVIDIA Mellanox ConnectX HW family of adapters is a complex beast,
supporting networking, InfiniBand, RDMA, and more.  As a result, the mlx5
kernel driver that supports this hardware is also complex, as is the
interface that it provides to user space.  The mlx5 developers have, for a
while now, been proposing
the addition of a new control interface, in the form of a separate virtual
device exported by the kernel, that would make vast amounts of debugging
information available.  This driver has encountered some significant
opposition on its way toward the mainline, though, raising a number of
questions about appropriate interfaces and when subsystem maintainers have
veto power over submissions.</span>

                              <span>Changwoo Min provides
an introduction to the sched_ext scheduling class:


	Sched_ext was proposed to address the problems mentioned above. It
	allows users to write a custom scheduling policy using BPF without
	modifying the kernel code. You don&#x27;t need to struggle to maintain
	the out-of-tree custom scheduler. In addition, BPF provides a safe
	kernel programming environment. In particular, the BPF verifier
	ensures that your custom scheduler has neither a memory bug nor an
	infinite loop. Also, if your custom scheduler misbehaves -- like
	failing to schedule a task for too long (say 30 seconds), the
	kernel portion of sched_ext kills your custom scheduler and falls
	back to the default kernel scheduler (CFS or EEVDF). Last but not
	least, you can update the BPF scheduler without reinstalling the
	kernel and rebooting a server.


(LWN looked at sched_ext in February 2023).</span>

                              <span>Users of mature C libraries conventionally get to choose how memory is
allocated — that is, when it cannot be avoided entirely. The C
standard never laid down a convention — perhaps for the better —
so each library re-invents an allocator interface. Not all are created
equal, and most repeat a few fundamental mistakes. Often the interface is
merely a token effort, to check off that it’s “supported” without actual
consideration to its use. This article describes the critical features of
a practical allocator interface, and demonstrates why they’re important.
Before diving into the details, here’s the checklist for library authors:
All allocation functions accept a user-defined context pointer.
The “free” function accepts the original allocation size.

                              <span>이 논문은 흔히 Row-hammer attack 으로 알려져 있는 공격에 대한 연구이다. 
Kim, Yoongu, et al. &quot;Flipping bits in memory without accessing them: An experimental study of DRAM disturbance errors.&quot; ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News 42.3 (2014): 361-372.
이 방식은 Hardware 에 대한 공격이라고 할 수 있다. 거의 모든 종류의 DRAM이 공통적으로 가지고 있는 이슈를 이용한 공격이다. (논문의 저자진은 삼성 및 Intel에서 인턴쉽을 수행한적이 있는 카네기 멜론 출신의 연구자들인데, 이 현상을 발견한 후 논문으로 발표를 하게 되어 회사들 입장에서는 약간 곤란했었다고 한다.)

DRAM이란 트랜지스터와 커패시터로 구성된 메모리 셀을 통해 데이터를 저장한다. 그리고 DRAM에 Access하거나 Refresh하는 방식으로 데이터를 관리한다. 원칙적으로 하나의 메모리 주소에 대한 접근은 다른 주소에 저장된 데이터에 의도하지 않은 영향을 미쳐서는 안된다. 이에 1970년대부터 DRAM 제조 업체들은 셀 간 간격을 유지하고 테스트를 통해 오류 발생 가능성을 최소화하고 있었다. 그러나 DRAM 공정 기술이 미세화됨에 따라 DRAM 셀 간의 전기적 상호 작용을 방지하기가 점점 더 어려워지고 있다. 


2014년 본 연구진의 실험에 따르면 상용 DRAM의 동일한 주소에 읽기 작업을 반복하다보면 인근 주소의 데이터를 손상시킬 수 있다는 것이 확인되었다. 마치 특정 row에 있는 부분을 해머로 계속 때리면 그 옆의 row들이 영향을 받는다는 취지에서 이름을 붙인 것이다. 일종의 Fault Injection 이라고 볼 수 있다. 
의도적으로 DRAM에 부하를 가하는 악의적인 프로그램을 통해, DRAM의 동일한 행을 활성화하는 것은 인근 행의 데이터를 손상시킬 수 있다는 사실을 인텔 및 AMD 주요 DRAM모듈(129개 중 110개)에서 확인하였다. 


해머링을 수행하다보면 트랜지스터 행에서 주변 인접한 행으로 전하가 누출되고, 그로 인해 메모리상의 특정 비트 값이 1에서 0으로, 또는 0에서 1로 뒤집힌다(flipping). 이 사소한 비트 전환으로 인해 운영체제 수준에서 권한 상승이 발생할 수도 있다. 실제로 이를 악용하여 시스템에서의 권한 상승이나 네트워크 기반 공격도 가능하다고 알려져 있다.


후속 연구에 대해서는 추후 더 다룰 예정.

process in the openSUSE project (covered in this article), the project has announced
that there will be a new vote:


	During the community meeting this week where the results were
	discussed, participants expressed the view that members of the
	openSUSE Project have an opportunity to participate in the
	selection of our new logo, and that SUSE, which holds the trademark
	to the openSUSE logo, be involved with the process for selecting a
	branding decision with regard to the results. After all, this
	decision impacts the collective identity.

	To facilitate this, there is a plan to organize a vote between the
	current logo and the proposed new design, allowing our community to
	have a say in this important decision. Furthermore, members of the
	project are collaborating with SUSE on the implications of the
	branding initiatives and some have expressed the desire for SUSE’s
	input to ensure there is an aligned vision for the future of
	openSUSE.</span>

                              <span>Wietse Venema posted a note to the postfix-users mailing list about the 25th anniversary of the Postfix mail server.  As can be seen, it had a pivotal role in bringing more awareness of open-source software to IBM.  Beyond that, of course, it is an excellent piece of software in its own right.


As a few on this list may recall, it is 25 years ago today that the
&quot;IBM secure mailer&quot; had its public beta release. This was accompanied
by a nice article in the New York Times business section.

There is some literature at https://www.postfix.org/press.html that
attests how this project accelerated open-source adoption by a very
large company.


That release was even noticed by a small publication in its first year of operation.

well, stable; when that promise is lived up to, users can update to newer
stable updates without fear.  By any account, a bug that corrupts data on
ext4 filesystems constitutes a failure to hold to that promise.  As is so
often the case, this problem is the result of a chain of failures in a
system that works well most of the time.</span>

                              <span>Kubernetes and Apache Kafka are becoming de-facto platforms for developing and deploying microservice architectures. 
Kafka is a distributed data streaming platform that enables applications to publish, subscribe to, store, and process streams of messages (or events) in real-time.
These messages are stored inside Kafka topics. A topic is a set of messages you aim to organize for consumption. Each topic is stored on disk, replicated across brokers to ensure fault tolerance, and messages within the topic are retained for a designated time. Figure 1 shows an overview of a Kafka cluster.


  Figure 1: Shows a Kafka broker with three topics, where different applications produce and consume messages from topics.
We can consider topics as a logical grouping for messages. A Kafka topic, however, i…</span>

                              <span>Nowadays, Fedora contributors use Packit a lot to keep packages up to date. In general, using the service is extremely easy, but as we will see, integrating it with a complex multi-source project with an extensive cryptographic test suite like the Go FIPS project needed a little tweaking. But the effort will be worth it.
The Go FIPS CI before Packit
In the Go FIPS repository, we use GitHub Actions to test the pull requests before merging them. We run the whole test suite with each pull request&#x27;s changes in several containers to ensure it works on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7, 8, and 9. The differences between these three versions of RHEL give us fantastic coverage, but there is a limitation. We can only build on AMD64 if we rely on GitHub Actions without external systems.

for the openSUSE project and for
four separate distributions of it, 
Tumbleweed, Leap, Slowroll, and  
Kalpa, has turned into a
bit of an uproar in that community.  A vote
has been held on the candidates and winners have been announced, but
some are questioning why there is a need to change the existing logo (the
&quot;Geeko&quot; 
chameleon) at all.  In addition, there are questions about whether the
new logo will be trademarked (as previous ones have been)—and how many
years that will take.</span>

                              <span>The Rust for Linux (RFL) project may not have (yet) resulted in user-visible
changes to the Linux kernel, but it seems the wider world has taken notice.
Hongyu Li has announced
that the Rust for Linux code is now part of a satellite just launched
out of China.  The satellite is running a system called RROS, which follows the old
RTLinux pattern of running a realtime kernel alongside Linux.  The realtime
core is written in Rust, using the RFL groundwork.


	Despite its imperfections, we still want to share RROS with the
	community, showcasing our serious commitment to using RFL for
	substantial projects and contributing to the community&#x27;s
	growth. Our development journey with RROS has been greatly enriched
	by the support and knowledge from the RFL community. We also have
	received invaluable assistance from enthusiastic forks here,
	especially when addressing issues related to safety abstraction

developers has been released under the Creative Commons BY-SA license.


	This document is not intended for end-users or implementers of
	OpenPGP libraries (or other software that directly handles internal
	OpenPGP data structures).

	Instead, this document is focused on the second group, application
	developers, who use OpenPGP functionality in their software
	projects. It describes the properties of the OpenPGP system and its
	uses. It presupposes solid knowledge of software development
	concepts and of general cryptographic concepts. Thus, this text
	describes OpenPGP at the “library-level,” teaching concepts that
	will help software developers get started as a user of any
	implementation (e.g., OpenPGP.js, Sequoia-PGP).</span>

                              <span>Throughout my career, people have compared software development to
  “traditional” engineering, usually in a way to scold software developers for not
  doing a proper job. As someone who got his degree in Electronic Engineering,
  this resonated with me early in my career. But this way of thinking is flawed
  because most people have the wrong impression of how engineering works in
  practice.
Glenn Vanderburg has spent a lot of time digging
  into these misconceptions, and I strongly urge anyone who wants to compare
  software development to engineering to watch his talk Real Software Engineering. It&#x27;s also well worth
  listening to his interview on the podcast Oddly
  Influenced. Sadly I&#x27;ve not been able to persuade him to write this
  material down - it would make a great article.
Another good thinker on this relationship is Hillel Wayne. He interviewed a
  bunch of “crossovers” - people who had worked both in traditional engineering
  and in software. He wrote up what he learned in a series of essays, starting
  with Are We Really Engineers?</span>

that the movement of kernel mailing lists away from the venerable
vger.kernel.org system is nearly complete:


	Over the past few months we&#x27;ve migrated all of the vger.kernel.org
	mailing lists, with the exception of the Big One (linux-kernel, aka
	LKML). This list alone is responsible for about 80% of all vger
	mailing list traffic, so we left it for the last.

	This Thursday, December 14, at 11AM Pacific (19:00 UTC), we will
	switch the MX record for vger to point to the new location

                              <span>The story of Canonical&#x27;s takeover of the LXD container manager, and the
subsequent creation of the Incus fork, has been
simmering for a while.  Now Incus developer Stéphane Graber reports
that Canonical has changed the license and contribution terms for LXD:


	Per the commit message performing the re-licensing, all further
	contributions will be under the AGPLv3 license and all
	contributions from Canonical employees have been re-licensed to
	AGPLv3.

	However, Canonical does not own the copyright on any contribution
	from non-employees, such as the many changes they have imported
	from Incus over the past few months. Those therefore remain under
	the Apache2 license that they were contributed under.

	As a result, Canonical cannot release LXD under the AGPLv3 license
	and likely never will be able to.  LXD is now under a weird mix of
	Apache2 and AGPLv3 with no clear metadata indicating what file or
	what part of each file is under one license or the other.


He also notes that this change will put an end to the flow of patches — in
either direction — between the two projects.</span>

Deploying TLS in client-router and router-service is possible to fortify the entire communication ecosystem.
Skupper ensures mutual TLS (mTLS) for inter-router communications by default, and users have the option to enhance security by enabling TLS specifically between services and the Skupper routers, with the flexibility to either auto-generate certificates through Skupp…</span>

                              <span>James Bottomley writes
that open-source developers are increasingly likely to be held liable for
flaws in their code and suggests a solution:


	Indemnification means one party, in particular circumstances,
	agreeing to be on the hook for the legal responsibilities of
	another party. This is actually a well known way not of avoiding
	liability but transferring it to where it belongs. As such, it’s
	easily sellable in the court of public opinion: we’re not looking
	to avoid liability, merely trying to make sure it lands on those
	who are making all the money from the code.</span>

                              <span>Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a technique for building
	software that guides software development by writing tests. It was
	developed by Kent
	Beck in the late 1990&#x27;s as part of
	Extreme Programming. In essence we follow three simple
	steps repeatedly:
Write a test for the next bit of functionality you want to add.
Write the functional code until the test passes.
Refactor both new and old code to make it well structured.


Although these three steps, often summarized as Red - Green -
  Refactor, are the heart of the process, there&#x27;s also a vital initial
  step where we write out a list of test cases first. We then pick one of these
  tests, apply red-green-refactor to it, and once we&#x27;re done pick the next.
  Sequencing the tests properly is a skill, we want to pick tests that drive us

                              <span>There might be occasions where over-provisioning your cluster will provide great benefit. If there are sudden bursts of pods being created in a short amount of time, there can be situations where a new node is spinning up but is not ready. This can cause issues as pods will stuck in a pending phase for about ten minutes whilst waiting for the new node. A solution to this is to over-provision your cluster. This enables a spare node at all times, or pre-emptily create a new node when the workflow starts to pick up.
Use cases
With this solution, pods are created that are considered low priority. When the more important workloads are created, the low priority pods get removed from the nodes. This leaves the low priority pods in a pending state. This forces Red Hat OpenShift to spawn a new node…</span>

                              <span>In this article, we’ll explore six practical string processing operations introduced in C++20 and C++23. These features represent an evolution in this crucial area, covering a spectrum of operations from searching and appending to creation and stream handling.
Let’s start with a simple yet long-awaited feature…
contains(), C++23 
  




     
    


Finally, after decades of standardization, we have a super easy way to check if there’s one string inside the other. No need to use .find(str) !&#x3D; npos!
Before C++23:
#include 
#include 

int main() {
    const std::string url &#x3D; &quot;https://isocpp.org&quot;;

    if (url.find(&quot;https&quot;) !&#x3D; std::string::npos &amp;&amp;
        url.find(&quot;.org&quot;) !&#x3D; std::string::npos &amp;&amp;
        url.find(&quot;isocpp&quot;) !&#x3D; std::string::npos)
        std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;You&#x27;re us…</span>

                              <span>There is a problem in multiple stable kernel releases that is causing data corruption in ext4 filesystems.  It is caused by a problematic commit that is in multiple stable kernels:

The commit got merged in 6.5-rc1 so all stable kernels that have
91562895f803 (&quot;ext4: properly sync file size update after O_SYNC direct
IO&quot;) before 6.5 are corrupting data - I&#x27;ve noticed at least 6.1 is still
carrying the problematic commit.


More information can be found in a Debian bug report. It has also delayed the release of Debian 12.3 images. &quot;Please do not upgrade any systems at this time, we urge caution for users
with UnattendeUpgrades configured.&quot;

                              <span>It can be instructive to pull down the dog-eared copy of the first edition
of The C Programming Language that many of us still have on our
bookshelves; the language has changed considerably since that book was
published.  Many &quot;features&quot; of early C have been left behind, usually for
good reasons, but there is still a lot of code in the wild that is still
using those features.  A concerted effort is being made in both the Fedora
and GCC communities to fix that old code and enable some new errors in the
GCC 14 release (which is in
stage 3 of its development cycle and likely to be released by
mid-2024), but a fair amount of work remains to be done.</span>

only added for 6.6, and is limited to the x86
architecture.  As support for other architectures (including arm64 and RISC-V) approaches readiness,
though, more thought is going into the API for this feature.  As a recent
discussion on the integration of shadow stacks with the clone3() system call shows, there are
still some details to be worked out.</span>

	As its name suggests, LogoFAIL involves logos, specifically those
	of the hardware seller that are displayed on the device screen
	early in the boot process, while the UEFI is still running. Image
	parsers in UEFIs from all three major IBVs [independent BIOS
	vendors] are riddled with roughly a dozen critical vulnerabilities
	that have gone unnoticed until now. By replacing the legitimate
	logo images with identical-looking ones that have been specially
	crafted to exploit these bugs, LogoFAIL makes it possible to
	execute malicious code at the most sensitive stage of the boot

In a previous blog post (Getting Started With Zephyr: Saving Data To Files), I demonstrated how to create an application using The Zephyr Project RTOS to store data on a microSD card. A microSD card can allow an embedded system to store tremendous amounts of data. The data can be stored locally when no Internet connection is present, or uploading data frequently is...</span>

                              <span>TableGenis a language used within the LLVM project for generating a variety of files,when manual maintenance would be very difficult.
For example, it is used to define all of the instructions that can be used on aparticular architecture. The information is defined in TableGen and we canproduce many things based on that single source file. C++ code, documentation,command line options, and so on.
TableGen has been in existence sincebeforethe first official release of LLVM, over 20 years ago.
Today in the LLVM project repository there areover a thousand TableGen source files totalling over 500,000 lines of code.Making it the 5th most popular language in the repository.

encryption has been around since 1997, when it was derived from the
venerable Pretty Good
Privacy (PGP) program that was released in 1991.  Since it came about,
OpenPGP has been the decentralized, interoperable way to exchange encrypted
email, though 
its use never really took off as advocates hoped. Now, though, it
would seem that a split in the OpenPGP community threatens to
fragment the OpenPGP-encrypted-email landscape, potentially leading to
interoperability woes.</span>

                              <span>Many processor vendors provide a mechanism to allow some bits of a pointer
value to be used to store unrelated data; these include Intel&#x27;s linear address masking (LAM), AMD&#x27;s upper address ignore, and Arm&#x27;s top-byte
ignore.  A set of researchers has now come up with a way (that
they call &quot;SLAM&quot;) to use those features to bypass many checks on pointer
validity, opening up a new set of Spectre attacks.


	In response to SLAM, Intel made plans to provide software guidance
	prior to the future release of Intel processors which support LAM
	(e.g., deploying LAM jointly with LASS). Linux engineers developed
	patches to disable LAM by default until further guidance is
	available. ARM published an advisory to provide guidance on future
	TBI-enabled CPUs. AMD did not implement guidance updates and
	pointed to existing Spectre v2 mitigations to address the SLAM
	exploit described in the paper.

(CVE) system is the main mechanism for tracking various security
flaws, 
using the omnipresent CVE number—even vulnerabilities with fancy names and
web sites
have CVE numbers. But the CVE system is not without its critics and, in
truth, the incentives between the reporting side and those responsible for
handling the bugs have always been misaligned, which leads to abuse of
various kinds.  There have been efforts to
combat some of those abuses along the way; a newly announced
&quot;!CVE&quot; project is meant to track vulnerabilities &quot;that are not
acknowledged by vendors but 
still are serious security issues&quot;.</span>

summary of the CXL microconference at the recently concluded Linux
Plumbers Conference.  &quot;The goals for the track were to openly discuss
current on-going development efforts around the core driver, as well as
experimental memory management topics which lead to accommodating kernel
infrastructure for new technology and use cases.&quot;</span>

                              <span>Regression bugs are newly appeared bugs in features of the software that have been around
  for a while. When hunting them, it usually valuable to figure out which change
  in the software caused them to appear. Looking at that change can give
  invaluable clues about where the bug is and how to squash it. There isn&#x27;t a
  well-known term for this form of investigation, but I call it Diff Debugging.
Diff debugging only works if we have our code in version control, but
  fortunately these days that&#x27;s the norm. But there are some more things that
  are needed to make it work effectively. We need Reproducible Builds, so that we can run old versions of
  the software easily. It helps greatly to have small commits, due to high-frequency
  integration. That way when we find the guilty commit, we …</span>

                              <span>The Android system was once famous for extensive, out-of-tree kernel
enhancements.  Many of those have been eliminated or upstreamed over
the years, bringing Android much closer to the mainline kernel.  One
significant component in the &quot;upstreamed&quot; category is Binder, an
interprocess communication mechanism that is used only by Android.  There
are a number of factors that make Binder a good candidate for rewriting in
the Rust language; at the 2023 Linux
Plumbers Conference, Carlos Llamas and Alice Ryhl described the
motivation behind and implementation of a rewrite of Binder in Rust.</span>

track at the 2023 Linux
Plumbers Conference (LPC), Stefan Roesch led a session on kernel
samepage merging (KSM).  He gave an overview of the feature and described
some recent changes to KSM.  He showed how
an application can enable KSM to deduplicate its memory and how the feature
can be evaluated to  determine whether it is a good fit for new workloads.
In addition, he provided some real-world data of the benefits from his
workplace at Meta.</span>

the &quot;acquisition&quot; of the Roundcube webmail system.


	As a product, Roundcube has an established path to success on its
	own. With opportunities remaining to be explored, a direct merger
	between Roundcube and Nextcloud is not planned. Neither will
	Roundcube replace Nextcloud Mail or the other way around. The
	products both have strengths and weaknesses and as open source
	products they already do share some underlying libraries and tools,
	but remain independent offerings for overlapping but different use
	scenarios. Nextcloud Mail will evolve as it is, focused on being
	used naturally within Nextcloud. Roundcube will continue to serve
	its active and new users as a stand-alone secure mail client.</span>

                              <span>도커(Docker)가 부분 유료화 정책을 시행하고 있다. 
개인 사용자를 위한 Personal 은 여전히 무료이다. 그리고 도커 자체가 오픈소스이므로 리눅스상에서 도커를 설치해서 운영하는 것은 전혀 지장이 없다.
유료화가 적용되는 경우는 &quot;Docker Desktop&quot;에 대한 부분, 그리고 &quot;기업 내 사용&quot;이 문제다. 
내가 개인적으로 내 컴퓨터에 도커 데스크탑을 설치하는 것은 비용이 발생하지 않지만, 회사 컴퓨터에는 도커 데스크탑을 설치해서는 안된다. 
macOS를 사용하는 경우, Docker Desktop을 설치하면 자체적으로 Aarch64 리눅스를 가상화하여 도커를 설치하고, 도커 데몬을 그쪽에 연결하는 것으로 보인다. 이 기능은 편리하지만, 회사에서는 이 방식을 사용할 수 없다.


그래서 대안으로 선택할 수 있는 것이 podman이다. podman은 데몬 방식을 사용하지 않는다는 것이 차이점이다.
https://podman.io/
podman은 무료이고 오픈소스이어서 회사 내 사용이 문제가 없는 것으로 보인다.
macOS 환경에서 podman은 QEMU기반의 가상 머신으로 동작한다. 
podman은 brew를 통해 설치할 수 있지만, 여기에서는 GUI 기반의 installer를 통해 Desktop 버전으로 설치해보자.
(사이트: https://podman-desktop.io/downloads )
나는 Apple M2 Pro가 탑재된 MacBook Pro를 사용하고 있으므로, arm64용 dmg파일을 다운받아 설치했다.
Podman Desktop을 실행하면 podman을 초기 설치하기 위한 세팅이 진행된다. 
Podman Setup을 통해 기본으로 사용될 podman-machine를 지정하고 생성한다.
이제 podman 이 설치되었을 것이다. 터미널에서 podman --help 명령어를 확인해보자.


사용을 희망하는 &#x27;도커&#x27; 이미지를 podman으로 pull 할 수 있다. 
$ podman pull aflplusplus/aflplusplus
pull 작업이 완료되면 해당 이미지를 기반으로 컨테이너를 실행할 수 있게 된다. Desktop에서 이미지를 선택하고 Run Image를 선택하면 된다.
컨테이너 화면에서 현재 실행중인 컨테이너를 확인할 수 있고, Tty를 통해 쉘 명령어를 테스트해볼 수도 있다.
podman도 Arm64 macOS에서 구동하면, 자체적으로 Aarch64 리눅스를 기반으로 하는 컨테이너를 선택하는 것 같다.


만약 굳이 intel용 컨테이너를 구동하고 싶다면? 
$ podman pull pwntools/pwntools:stable --arch x86_64
이렇게 --arch 옵션으로 x86_64를 지정해준다.
이렇게 실행된 컨테이너는 x86_64로 작동하고 있음을 알 수 있다. 이것은 사실 macOS의 입장에서는 어차피 qemu기반으로 컨테이너가 동작하기 때문에 x86_64인 컨테이너를 실행하도록 한 것과 같다.</span>

debugger was developed by Omar Sandoval for use in his job on the kernel
team at Meta. He now spends most of his time working on drgn, both in
developing new features for the tool and in using
it to debug production problems at Meta, which gives him a view of both
ends of that feedback loop.  At the 2023 
Linux Plumbers 
Conference (LPC), he led a session on drgn in the kernel debugging
microconference, where he wanted to brainstorm on how to add some new
features to the debugger and, in particular, how to allow them to work on
production kernels.</span>

                              <span>Over the last year, lots of developers have incorporated LLM coding
     assistants into their work, finding them a useful tool. But one of the
     problems of these tools is that they are unreliable, often coming up with
     poor or outright wrong-headed suggestions. Birgitta
     Böckeler continues her exploration of GenAI for developers by
     passing on what she&#x27;s learned about how think about this unreliability, and
     why it may be good to call your LLM tool “Dusty”.

Torvalds discusses the problems that he has been encountering.  In recent
years, though, there have been relatively few of those problems, so this
year he turned things around a bit by asking
the community what problems it was seeing instead.  He then addressed
them at the Summit in a session covering aspects of the development
community, including feedback to maintainers, diversity (or the
lack thereof), and more.</span>

NetIdee for some time.  Indeed,
I’ve discussed this project several times
on the blog.  I first brought it up in the context of building a Virtual Packet
FIFO.  The topic then came
up again during two articles on building an SDIO (SD-Card)
controller: first when discussing how to
build a Verilog test bench for
it, and then again when
discussing what bugs managed to slip past the verification, which then had to
be caught in hardware.
What we haven’t yet discussed is the switch itself, and how it works.
When discussing this project, I’ve often shown the component
diagram below.

     been developing a collection of patterns to help us all better understand
     how modern distributed systems work. We&#x27;ve been publishing drafts of these
     patterns on this site. Now these have turned into a book, published
     by Addison-Wesley in my signature series. As such, we&#x27;ve now removed
     the work-in-progress drafts from this site, and have replaced them with a
     catalog of pattern
     summaries. For those with a subscription to oreilly.com, we have deep
     links from the summaries to the relevant chapter of the online book.
