                    <span>The &quot;Meta for Developers&quot; blog has an
introduction to the drgn kernel debugger.


	drgn (pronounced “dragon”) is a debugger that exposes the types and
	variables in a program for easy, expressive scripting in
	Python. The Linux kernel team at Meta originally built drgn to make
	it easier to investigate the kinds of difficult Linux kernel bugs
	that the team encounters at Meta. The team has since added further
	use cases for it, like monitoring and userspace memory profiling.


LWN reported on drgn in 2019.</span>

                    <span>Regressions are no fun; among other things, finding the source of a
regression among thousands of changes can be a needle-in-the-haystack sort
of problem.  The git
bisect 
command can help; it is a (relatively) easy way to sift through 
large numbers of commits to find the one that introduces a regression.  When it
works well, it can quickly point out the change that causes a specific
problem.  Bisection is not a perfect tool, though; it can go badly wrong in
situations where a bug cannot be reliably reproduced.  In an attempt to
make bisection more useful in such cases, Jan Kara is proposing to add &quot;stochastic
bisection&quot; support to Git.</span>

                    <span>PostgreSQL developer Robert Haas has begun
a blog series on what would be needed to allow database administrators
to safely delegate superuser powers.


	Consider, for example, the case of a service provider who would
	like to support a database with multiple customers as tenants. The
	customers will naturally want to feel as if they have the powers of
	a true superuser, with the ability to do things like create new
	roles, drop old ones, change permissions on objects that they don&#x27;t
	own, and generally enjoy the freedom to bypass permission checks at
	the SQL level which superusers enjoy. The service provider, who is
	the true superuser, also wants this, but does not want the
	customers to be able to do the really scary things that a superuser
	can do, like changing archive_command to
	rm -rf / or deleting the 
	entire contents of pg_proc so that the system crashes and the
	database in which the operation was performed is permanently
	ruined.</span>

                    <span>Amazon has asked the FCC to approve an outdoor Sidewalk-capable device called the Amazon Sidewalk Ring Bridge Pro, which is designed for professional installation as opposed to being a consumer-oriented technology. This signals that Amazon is planning to take its Sidewalk network to the next level by either providing more robust coverage in areas where […]

                    <span>Feature deprecations are often controversial, but many projects find it
necessary, or desirable, to lose some of the baggage that has accreted over
time.  A mid-November request to get rid of three Python standard library
modules provides a case in point.  It was initially greeted as a good idea
since the modules had been officially deprecated starting with
Python 3.6; there are better ways to accomplish their
tasks now.  But, of course, removing a module breaks any project that uses
it, at least without the project making some, perhaps even trivial,
changes.  The cost of that is not insignificant, and the value in doing so
is not always clear, which led to higher-level conversation about deprecations.</span>

of attention (and work) for what is, or seemingly should be, a fairly small
component of the kernel.  In part that is because random numbers, and
their quality, are extremely important to a number of security
protections, from unpredictable IP-packet sequence numbers to cryptographic
keys.  A recent post of
version 43 of the Linux Random Number 
Generator (LRNG) by Stephan Müller is not likely to go any further than its
predecessors, but the discussion around it may lead to support for a
feature that some distributions need.</span>

                    <span>Many commercial integration tools market their ability to own the
      integration landscape and call out to general purpose languages as needed.
      While I can appreciate the marketing behind such messaging — it promotes
      product penetration and lock-in — as architectural guidance, it is exactly
      backwards. Instead, we should almost always manage the interface evolution
      in a general purpose language for at least two reasons: so we can better
      manage the complexity of maintaining a clean interface, and so that we
      avoid the gravitational pull of our tool&#x27;s mental model when making
      strategic integration decisions.

Since this presentation, significant progress has been made on this on the infra side, so the situation is much improved over what was presented, but I think this is still relevant since, from talking to folks at peer companies, many folks are facing similar issues.
We frequently use tail latency metrics here at Twitter. Most frequently, service owners want to get cluster-wide or Twitter-wide latency numbers for their services. Unfortunately, the numbers that service owners tend to use differ from what we&#x27;d like to meas…</span>

doing, the 2021
annual report is available as an 87-page PDF file.


	In 2021, The Linux Foundation continued to see organizations
	embrace open collaboration and open source principles, accelerating
	new innovations, approaches, and best practices. As a community, we
	made significant progress in the areas of cloud-native computing,

                    <span>Reference counts are a commonly used mechanism for tracking the life cycle
of objects in a computing system.  As long as every user of an object
correctly maintains its references by incrementing and decrementing the
reference count, that object will persist for as long as it
is needed
and will be properly destroyed once the last user is done.  The &quot;correctly&quot;
in that sentence is important, though; things do not work
as well in the presence of reference-counting errors.  Networking
developer Eric Dumazet is working on a
reference-count tracking system that could prove useful for finding
these errors in the networking subsystem and, someday, throughout the kernel.</span>

                    <span>In this post we&#x27;re going to walk through how to use GitHub Actions to create a continuous integration (CI) pipeline that automatically tests, vets and lints your Go code.
For solo projects I usually create a pre-commit Git hook to carry out these kinds of checks, but for team projects or open-source work — where you don&#x27;t have control over everyone&#x27;s development environment — using a CI workflow is a great way to flag up potential problems and help catch bugs before they make it into production or a versioned release.
And if you&#x27;re already using GitHub to host your repository, it&#x27;s nice and easy to use their built-in functionality to do this without any need for additional third-party tools or services.
To demonstrate how it works, let&#x27;s run through a step-by-step example.

                    <span>This article was discussed on Hacker News.
I recently learned of csvquote, a tool that encodes troublesome
CSV characters such that unix tools can correctly process them. It
reverses the encoding at the end of the pipeline, recovering the original
input. The original implementation handles CSV quotes using the
straightforward, naive method. However, there’s a better approach that is
not only simpler, but around 3x faster on modern hardware. Even more,
there’s yet another approach using SIMD intrinsics, plus some bit
twiddling tricks, which increases the processing speed by an order of
magnitude. My csvquote implementation includes both
approaches.
Background
Records in CSV data are separated by line feeds, and fields are separated
by commas. Fields may be quoted.

                    <span>The CentOS blog has announced the release of CentOS Stream 9:

CentOS Stream is a continuous-delivery distribution providing each point-release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). Before a package is formally introduced to CentOS Stream, it undergoes a battery of tests and checks—both automated and manual—to ensure it meets the stringent standards for inclusion in RHEL. Updates posted to Stream are identical to those posted to the unreleased minor version of RHEL. The aim? For CentOS Stream to be as fundamentally stable as RHEL itself.

To achieve this stability, each major release of Stream starts from a stable release of Fedora Linux—In CentOS Stream 9, this begins with Fedora 34, which is the same code base from which RHEL 9 is built. As updated packages pass testing and meet standards for stability, they are pushed into CentOS Stream as well as the nightly build of RHEL.</span>

                    <span>It is natural, when looking at the kernel development process, to focus on
patches that find their way to acceptance and become a part of future
kernels.  But there can be value in looking at work that doesn&#x27;t clear the
bar; in failing, these patches often reveal things about the kernel and the
community that creates it.  Such is the case with the proof-of-concept
namespacefs
patch series recently posted by Yordan Karadzhov.  One should not
expect to see namespacefs in a future kernel but, in failing, this work
showed a real use case and why it is hard to satisfy that use case in the
kernel.</span>

                    <span>Writing (correct) concurrent code that uses locking to avoid race
conditions is difficult enough.  When the objective is to use lockless algorithms, relying on memory
barriers instead of locks to eliminate locking overhead, the problem
becomes harder 
still.  Bugs are easy to create and hard to find in this type of code.
There may be some help on the way, though, in the form of this
patch set from Marco Elver that enhances the Kernel
Concurrency 
Sanitizer (KCSAN) with  the ability to detect some types of missing
memory barriers.</span>

                    <span>Over on the Project Zero blog, Tavis Ormandy has a lengthy postmortem on a vulnerability that he found in the Network Security Services (NSS) cryptography library.  The vulnerability is a bog-standard buffer overflow that has existed in the library since 2012 despite various kinds of static analysis, testing, and fuzzing that Mozilla and others have applied to it over the years.  He found it with a new fuzzing technique:

To solve this problem, I’ve been experimenting with monitoring the call stack during execution.

The naive implementation is too slow to be practical, but after a lot of optimization I had come up with a library that was fast enough to be integrated into coverage-guided fuzzing, and was testing how it performed with NSS and other libraries.

[...] The fuzzer I was using is able to isolate and extract interesting new ASN.1 OIDs, SEQUENCEs, INTEGERs, and so on. Once extracted, it can then randomly combine or insert them into template data. This isn’t really a new idea, but is a new implementation. I&#x27;m planning to open source this code in the future.</span>

Fedora
elections led to a discussion on the Fedora devel mailing list that
branched into a few different directions.  The question was related to a
struggle that the distribution has had before: whether using non-free Git
forges is appropriate.  One of the
differences this time, though, is that the focus is on where source-git (or src-git)
repositories will be hosted, which is a separate question from where the dist-git repository
lives.</span>

an update on its suit against Vizio for
copyleft license violations.  Vizio&#x27;s response was not to release the
source code:

Instead, Vizio filed
a request to &quot;remove&quot; the case from California State Court (into US federal
court), which indicates Vizio&#x27;s belief that consumers have no
third-party beneficiary rights under copyleft! In other words, Vizio’s
answer to this complaint is not to comply with the copyleft licenses, but instead imply that Software Freedom Conservancy — and all other purchasers of the devices who might want to assert their right under GPL and LGPL to complete, corresponding source — have no right to even ask for that source code.</span>

                    <span>Posted by Jessica Dene Earley-Cha, Developer Relations Engineer
 Like many other people who use their smartphone to make their lives easier, I’m way more likely to use an app that adapts to my behavior and is customized to fit me. Android apps already can support some personalization like the ability to long touch an app and a list of common user journeys are listed. When I long press my Audible app (an online audiobook and podcast service), it gives me a shortcut to the book I’m currently listening to; right now that is Daring Greatly by Brené Brown.  
Now, imagine if these shortcuts could also be triggered by a voice command –    and, when relevant to the user, show up in Google Assistant for easy use. 
 Wouldn&#x27;t that be lovely?

and so on (i.e. identifiers) in the Python language, there are some
guidelines on how those things should be named.   But, of course, those
guidelines were not always followed in 
the standard library, especially in the early years of the project.  A
suggestion to add aliases to the standard library for
identifiers that do not follow the guidelines seems highly unlikely to go
anywhere, but it led to an interesting

      Building software is risky and expensive, and software product companies
      can spread that risk and expense across multiple customers. But my

      of tools that are available to buy for systems integration are not

 Google Developer Groups (GDGs) around the world are in a unique position to organize events on technology topics that community members are passionate about.  That’s what happened in Spain in July 2021, where two GDG chapters decided to put on an event called AI Fest after noticing a lack of conferences dedicated exclusively to artificial intelligence. “Artificial intelligence is everywhere, although many people do not know it,” says Irene Ruiz Pozo, the organizer of GDG Murcia and GDG Cartagena. While AI has the potential to transform industries from retail to real estate with products like Dialogflow and Lending DocAI, “there are still companies falling behind,” she notes.

                    <span>One of the key features of the extended BPF virtual machine is the verifier
built into the kernel that ensures that all BPF programs are safe to run.
BPF developers often see the verifier as a bit of a mixed blessing, though;
while it can catch a lot of problems before they happen, it can also be
hard to please.  Comparisons with a well-meaning but rule-bound and picky
bureaucracy would not be entirely misplaced.  The bpf_loop()
proposal from Joanne Koong is an attempt to make pleasing the BPF
bureaucrats a bit easier for one type of loop construct.</span>

The first time I wrote Space War was in 1978.  I wrote it in Alcom, which was a simple derivative of Focal, which was an analog of Basic for the PDP-8.  The computer was an M365 which was an augmented version of a PDP-8 and was proprietery to Teradyne, my employer at the time.

                    <span>Version
8.1.0 of the PHP language has been released.  This release includes a
number of new features, including enumerations,
read-only
properties,
fibers, and more.

Meanwhile, a
new foundation has been created to support development of PHP:


	The initial purpose of the PHP Foundation is to support the
	development of PHP by contracting developers to work on php-src
	either part-time or full-time. If that sounds interesting to you,
	be sure to apply!

	The foundation does not have any decision-making power on language
	changes: these remain within the sole purview of the internals
	mailing list and the RFC process. The fact that some work has been
	funded by the foundation does not imply that it will be accepted
	into PHP.

                    <span>In this short post we&#x27;re going to discuss how to add, modify or delete URL query string parameters in Go. To illustrate, we&#x27;ll look at how to change this URL:



To this:



If you want to change the URL query string in place:

  

Running this will print out:



If you want to create a clone of the URL but with a different query string, while leaving the original URL unchanged, you need to create a copy of the original url.URL struct first. 
There are a couple of ways to do this. You can either re-parse the URL, or you can dereference the original url.URL and make a copy, like so:



When you do this, you create a new newURL variable of type url.URL which is initialized to the (dereferenced) value of *originalURL. This means that newURL has a different address in memory to originalURL.
Putting this together, the pattern for creating a new URL with different parameters is:



Running this will print out:



As a side note, you can use this technique any time you want to &#x27;clone&#x27; a URL and make changes to it. For example to create a clone of a URL with a different path, you can do this:</span>

                    <span>In different programming languages, the behavior of virtual functions differs when it comes to constructors and destructors. Incorrect use of virtual functions is a classic mistake. Developers often use virtual functions incorrectly. In this article, we discuss this classic mistake. I suppose the reader is familiar with virtual functions in C++. Let&#x27;s get straight to the point. When we call a virtual function in a constructor, the function is overridden only within a base class or a currently created class. Constructors in the derived classes have not yet been called. Therefore, the virtual functions implemented in them will not be called. Let me illustrate this.</span>

    Interactive Canvas helps developers build multimodal apps for games, storytelling, and educational experiences on smart displays like the Nest Hub and Nest Hub Max. Setting up an Interactive Canvas app involves building a web app, a conversational model, and a server-based fulfillment to respond to voice commands. All three of these components need to be built out to test your apps using the simulator in the Actions Console. This works for teams who are able to build all three at once… but it means that everything has to be hooked up, even if you just want to test out the web portion of your app. In many cases, the web app provides the bulk of the functionality of an Interactive Canvas app. We recently published Interactive Canvas Dev…</span>

                    <span>왜 데빗(M. Devitt)이 계속 책을 쓰지 않는가 생각하다가 그의 나이를 살펴보니 벌써 83세이다. 나는 그가 이렇게 늙었다고 전혀 생각하지 못했다. 내가 데빗의 책을 열심히 수집한 것이 2000년 초 같은데, 내 시간 관념이 여전히 거기에 머무르고 있다. 게다가 이 당시에 전개되었던 분석철학이 오늘날 전개되는 양상보다 더 흥미롭다고 느낀다. 아마 이것이 바로 과거를 살고 있는 인간이 보여주는 전형적 모습일 것이다. 자기에게 친숙한 것을 좋아하는 그러한 경향 말이다. 그러나 어떤 공통적 주제 없이 산만하게 전개되는 철학적 활동보다는 그 당시에 여러 철학자들의 공통적 논의 주제가 되었던 실재론, 진리, 의미에 대한 논의가 더 철.......</span>

A list that included everything, including typos would both be uninteresting for other people to read as well as high overhead for me, which is why I&#x27;ve drawn the line somewhere.

Perceiving that one is not like everyone else can be painful. Yet, the experience can also be illuminating. As a child in Brazil, João Victor Ipirajá, lead of the Google Student Developer Club (GDSC) at the Federal Institute of Science and Technology of Ceará (IFCE), knew he was different. He often felt overwhelmed by physical sensations and missed social cues. When he was eventually diagnosed as being on the autistic spectrum, he was actually relieved. Far from being a limitation, the realization gave him a new perspective on his intellectual strengths—such as his ability to perceive mathematical concepts in a highly visual way and his capacity for logical thinking and computer programming. “I was reborn…</span>

                    <span>New Standard, new ways to initialize objects!
With C++20, we get a handy way of initializing data members. The new feature is called designated initializers and might be familiar to C programmers.
Let’s have a look at this small feature:
The basics
Designated Initialization is a form of Aggregate Initialization.
As of C++20, an Aggregate type::
is an array type or,
is a class type that:

has no private or protected direct non-static data members
has no user-declared or inherited constructors
has no virtual, private, or protected base classes
has no virtual member functions
In a basic form in C++20, you can write:
Type obj &#x3D; { .designator &#x3D; val, .designator &#x3D; val2, ... };
// or
Type obj &#x3D; { .designator { val }, .designator { val2 }, ... };


For example:

                    <span>It&#x27;s cool when enthusiastic developers create a working clone of a famous game. It&#x27;s even cooler when people are ready to continue the development of such projects! In this article, we check TheXTech with PVS-Studio. TheXTech is an open implementation of the game from the Super Mario universe. TheXTech is the SMBX 1.3. game engine rewritten on C++. The original SMBX (Super Mario Bros. X) was written on Visual Basic 6 by Andrew Spinks in 2009. It allows to create levels from the elements of the Nintendo&#x27;s Super Mario Bros games. TheXTech accurately reproduces the original game&#x27;s behavior. It also includes optional bug fixes. It runs not only on Windows, but also on macOS, and Linux systems with x86, ARM or PowerPC processors. Some developers also ported it on 3DS and PS Vista The TheXTech developer — Vitaliy Novichkov (Wohlstand) — described the development process in detail on Habr. He also described the techniques he used to smooth out the differences when porting the project from VB6 to C++. There&#x27;s a disclaimer on the GitHub page that explains why the source code is not in the best condition. It&#x27;s because the original code is unstructured something fierce. Its fragments you&#x27;ll see below.</span>

that effectively tweaks a single line of code.  Occasionally, though, such
a patch can expose a disagreement over how the behavior of the kernel

from Drew DeVault, who is evidently taking a break from stirring up
the npm community, is a case in point.  It brings to light the question
of how  the kernel community should pick default values for configurable

                    <span>One of the mechanisms of static analysis is method annotations of popular libraries. Annotations provide more information about functions during errors detecting. CARLA is an impressive open-source project in C++ that helped us implement this mechanism to our analyzer. Subsequently, the simulator became a test-target for the improved PVS-Studio static analyzer. CARLA is an open-source simulator for autonomous driving research. CARLA has been developed from the ground up to support development, training, and validation of autonomous driving systems. In addition to open-source code and protocols, CARLA provides open digital assets (urban layouts, buildings, vehicles) that were created for this purpose and can be used freely. The simulation platform supports flexible specification of sensor suites and environmental conditions. The project is cross-platform and contains almost 78,000 lines of C++ code. In the project repository, we also found code written in Python, XML, YAML, DOS Batch, CMake and other languages.</span>

                    <span>In this blog post, I’d like to summarize the main points I talked about in the
relicensing update presentation at the 2021 LLVM Developer’s meeting.
The very short summary is that we are currently in the long tail phase of
collecting relicensing agreements of past contributors. We already at the time
of this writing have more than 94% of older code relicensed. We hope to crowd
source getting through the long tail to get as close to 100% as possible.
Call for help
You can help by looking through the list of remaining individuals and
corporations we need to get agreements
from,
and reaching out to them, or letting us know at license-questions@llvm.org how
we can reach out to them. Also, if you’d happen to have any other information that you think could help us, please do let us know at licen…</span>

                    <span>The kernel provides a number of macros internally to allow code to generate
warnings when something goes wrong.  It does not, however, provide a lot of
guidance regarding what should happen when a warning is issued.  Alexander
Popov recently posted a
patch series adding an option for the system&#x27;s response to warnings;
that series seems unlikely to be applied in anything close to its current
form, but it did succeed in provoking a discussion on how warnings should
be handled.</span>

 Google’s Business Messages let customers message a business directly from Google Search, Google Maps, and any brand-managed property. Developers of Business Messages can leverage tools like Dialogflow to create AI-powered conversational experiences, where customers can chat with lifelike virtual agents that understand, interact, and talk in natural ways. Meanwhile the business can leverage real life agents when needed. 
In this article, I’ll give a brief overview of Business Messages, how to get started developing with the platform, and then walkthrough how to set up an AI-powered conversion using the Bot-in-a-Box feature.

                    <span>Even encrypted data sent on the internet leaves some footprints—metadata
about where packets originate, where they are bound, and when they are sent. 
Mix networks are
meant to hide that metadata by routing packets through various intermediate
nodes to try to thwart the traffic analysis used by nation-state-level
adversaries to identify &quot;opponents&quot; of various kinds. Tor is perhaps the
best-known mix network, but there are others that make different
tradeoffs to increase the security of their users.  Rollercoaster
is a recently announced mechanism that extends the functionality of mix
networks in order to more efficiently communicate among groups.</span>

                    <span>The .NET Foundation is an independent organization, created by Microsoft, to support open-source projects around the DotNet platform. Currently, the organization gathered many libraries under its wing. We have already tested some of these libraries with the help of PVS-Studio. The next project to check with the analyzer - LINQ to DB.  LINQ to DB is a database access framework based on LINQ. LINQ to DB has collected the best of its predecessors. It allows you to work with various DBMS, whereas LINQ to SQL back in the day allowed you to work only with MS SQL. It&#x27;s not as heavy and complicated as LINQ to SQL or Entity Framework. LINQ to DB provides more control and quick access to data. The framework is not that big: it&#x27;s written in C# and contains more than 40,000 lines of code. LINQ to DB is also one of the .NET Foundation projects. We have previously checked the projects of this organization: Windows Forms, Xamarin.Forms, Teleric UI for UWP, etc.</span>

 Last year we launched Google Pay’s Business Console, a platform that helps developers discover, integrate with, and manage Google Pay features for their businesses. Since then, integrating Google Pay products has become easier and faster, with features like a common business profile and a unified dashboard.  
Today, we are adding Passes as a new section to Google Pay’s Business Console, so you can manage all your Google Pay resources from one place. You can find the new Passes section in the console’s left-hand navigation bar, and from there, access your tickets, loyalty programs, offers and other passes resources.

rippling through various development
communities since their disclosure on 
November 1.  The oddities that can arise when handling Unicode, and
bidirectional Unicode in particular, in a programming 
language have led Rust, for
example, to check for
the problematic code points in strings and comments and, by default,
refuse to compile if they are present.  Python has chosen a different path,
but work is underway to help inform programmers of the kinds of pitfalls that

https://github.com/google/syzkaller/
syzkaller 는 QEMU 기반으로 운영체제를 부팅한 후 Host 와 Guest 사이에 ssh 연결을 수립하고 system call fuzzing 을 수행하는 도구다. 일반적으로 syzkaller 는 x86 리눅스 위에서 테스트 대상 x86 리눅스를 QEMU로 테스트하는 방식으로 많이 사용된다. 그러나 이 글에서는 Aarch64 리눅스를 테스트하고자 한다.
전체적인 과정은 공식 메뉴얼을 따랐지만, 설명이 친절한 편이 아니어서 직접 삽질을 하면서 다시 정리해보았다.


1. Kernel Build (with KASAN)
테스트 하고자 하는 리눅스 커널을 빌드한다. 앞선 글에서 설명했으나, 그때는 별다른 보안 옵션을 설정하지 않았다. 지금은 KASAN, KCOV 등의 새니타이징 기능을 켜고 퍼즈 테스트 성능을 측정할 수 있도록 하는 부분이 다르다. 
일단 x86에서 진행하는 것이라면 크로스 컴파일을 통해 Aarch64 리눅스 커널을 빌드할 필요성이 있다. 크로스 컴파일을 위한 툴 체인을 받아야 한다.

                    <span>One of the most common mistakes I see people make when looking at data is incorrectly using an overly simplified model. A specific variant of this that has derailed the majority of work roadmaps I&#x27;ve looked at is treating people as interchangeable, as if it doesn&#x27;t matter who is doing what, as if individuals don&#x27;t matter.
Individuals matter.
A pattern I&#x27;ve repeatedly seen during the roadmap creation and review process is that people will plan out the next few quarters of work and then assign some number of people to it, one person for one quarter to a project, two people for three quarters to another, etc. Nominally, this process enables teams to understand what other teams are doing and plan appropriately.

     Merchant Center lets merchants manage how their in-store and online product     inventory appears on Google. It allows them to reach hundreds of millions     of people looking to buy products like yours each day. 

    To upload their products, merchants can make use of feeds, that is, files     with a list of products in a specific format. These can be shared with     Merchant Center in different ways: using Google Sheets, SFTP or FTP shares,     Google Cloud Storage or manually through the user interface. These methods     work great for the majority of cases. But, if a merchant&#x27;s product list     grows over time, they might reach the usage limits of the feeds.

                    <span>Get it here: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-399/

Python 3.9.9 is the eighth maintenance release of the legacy 3.9 series. Python 3.10 is now the latest feature release series of Python 3. Get the latest release of 3.10.x here.

3.9.9 was released out of schedule as a hotfix for an argparse regression in Python 3.9.8 which caused complex command-line tools to fail recognizing sub-commands properly. Details in BPO-45235. There are only three other bugfixes in this release compared to 3.9.8. See the changelog for details on what changed.

Upgrading to 3.9.9 is highly recommended if you’re running Python 3.9.8.

The next Python 3.9 maintenance release will be 3.9.10, currently scheduled for 2022-01-03.

We apologize for the inconvenience

…and still hope you’ll enjoy the new release!

	ort does just that: it’s a full-blown rewrite of the merge strategy
	that aims to emulate the same concepts behind recursive while
	avoiding many of its long-standing performance and correctness
	problems. In a merge containing many renames, ort outperforms
	recursive by 500x. For a series of similar merges (like in a rebase

5.16-rc1 and ended the 5.16 merge window on November 14, as

the first half of the merge window was written.  As is usually the case,
the patch mix in the latter part of the merge window tended more toward

In this blog post, we’ll explore a technique called “heterogenous access” that offers such impressive speedups. We’ll explore ordered containers, and the support for unordered collections added recently in C++20.
Recap on heterogeneous lookup in ordered containers
Let’s bring the example and have a look at how this feature works for ordered containers.
If you have the following code:
std::map intMap { 
    { &quot;Hello Super Long String&quot;, 1 }, 
    { &quot;Another Longish String&quot;, 2 }, 
    { &quot;This cannot fall into SSO buffer&quot;, 3 }
};

std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Lookup in intMap with by const char*:\n&quot;;
std::cout &lt;&lt; intMap.contains(&quot;Hello Super Long String&quot;) &lt;&lt; &#x27;\n&#x27;;

                    <span>RPCS3 is an interesting project that emulates the PS3 console. It is actively evolving. Recently we heard the news that the emulator learned how run all the games from the console&#x27;s catalog. That&#x27;s a good excuse to analyze the project. We&#x27;ll see which errors remained after new fixes were added to the project. The project is quite hefty. It contains about 300 thousand lines of C++ code and relies upon many external dependencies that include the following: For the GUI part, the project uses Qt - however, that is taken from the system library. The screenshot below demonstrates the full list of dependencies:</span>

                    <span>미루고 미루던 리눅스 커널 취약점 연구를 올해가 가기 전에 최소한 &#x27;시작&#x27;은 해보려고 한다. 
아직 초보인데, Defenit팀의 김현우(V4bel)님께서 인프런에서 진행하시는 강좌가 정말 큰 도움이 되었다.
https://www.inflearn.com/course/%EB%A6%AC%EB%88%85%EC%8A%A4-%EC%BB%A4%EB%84%90-%ED%95%B4%ED%82%B9/
해당 강좌는 Intel x86_64 환경을 기준으로 되어있는데, 이를 Aarch64 리눅스로 하여 열심히 삽질 중이다. 변환했을 때 똑같이 적용되는 것도 있고, 안 되는 것도 많다..


우선 Aarch64 환경에서 커널 빌드 및 디버깅을 하기 위한 절차를 기록해둔다. 대부분의 내용은 위에서 언급한 강좌에서 김현우님께서 가이드해주신 방법을 참고했으며, Aarch64 로 변환할 때 필요한 수정사항들을 내가 작성했다(이 게시물은 강사님의 허락을 받고 기록해두는 것이다.)
 
(참고로 1~3번 과정을 생략하고, 내가 올려둔 파일을 다운로드 하셔도 됨)
1. 리눅스 커널 빌드
우선 리눅스 커널을 직접 빌드할 수 있는 환경이 마련되어야 한다. 강의에서는 인텔 리눅스 상에서 인텔 리눅스를 빌드하는 방식으로 진행되었다. 그러나 Aarch64 아키텍처용 리눅스를 빌드하려면 방법이 달라진다. 대략 두가지 방법이 있다.
1) Intel 리눅스상에서 cross-compiler 를 사용해서 Aarch64 리눅스 이미지를 빌드하는 방법.
2) Aarch64 리눅스 상에서 Aarch64 리눅스를 빌드하는 방법.
그동안은 대부분 1의 방법이 선호되었다. 왜냐…</span>

                    <span>Over on the Google Security blog, Jonathan Metzman announced the release of ClusterFuzzLite, which is &quot;a continuous fuzzing solution that runs as part of CI/CD workflows to find vulnerabilities faster than ever before&quot;.   ClusterFuzzLite is a descendant of OSS-Fuzz, which we looked at in 2017.

Large projects including systemd and curl are already using ClusterFuzzLite during code review, with positive results. According to Daniel Stenberg, author of curl, “When the human reviewers nod and have approved the code and your static code analyzers and linters can&#x27;t detect any more issues, fuzzing is what takes you to the next level of code maturity and robustness. OSS-Fuzz and ClusterFuzzLite help us maintain curl as a quality project, around the clock, every day and every commit.”

[...] To learn more, check out the ClusterFuzzLite documentation. ClusterFuzzLite currently supports GitHub Actions, Google Cloud Build and Prow. We built this with CI system extensibility in mind, and adding support for other CI systems is straightforward. Please contact us if you’re interested in contributing support, or have any questions, feedback or feature requests.</span>

                    <span>People often see work in support as something negative. Today we&#x27;ll look at it from a different perspective. This article is about a real communication of 100+ messages, exceptions, the analysis that didn&#x27;t complete in three days... Actually, bug reports are great If a bug report is adequately handled from both sides, it means that both the user and the software developer are interested in solving the problem. If both sides achieve the desired result, it&#x27;s a win-win situation. Before we proceed to the story, here&#x27;s a little introduction. We are the PVS-Studio team. We develop the analyzer that searches for errors and potential vulnerabilities in C, C++, C#, and Java code. Yours truly is the team lead of the C# analyzer development team, the author of articles and posts.</span>

                    <span>While the &quot;Trojan Source&quot; vulnerabilities
have, thus far, generated far more publicity than examples of actual
exploits, addressing the problem still seems like a good thing to do.
There are several places where defenses could be put into place; text
editors, being the place where developers look at a lot of code, are one
obvious example.  The discussion of how to enhance Emacs in this regard has
made it clear, though, that there are multiple opinions about how an editor
should flag potential attacks.</span>

                    <span>On November 10, the Go programming language community celebrated the 12th anniversary of its release as open-source software.  The post covers a number of different topics, including the consolidation of web sites at go.dev, releases and their features over the last year, as well as a look to the future:

In February, the Go 1.18 release will expand the new register-based calling convention to non-x86 architectures, bringing dramatic performance improvements with it. It will include the new Go fuzzing support. And it will be the first release to include support for generics.

Generics will be one of our focuses for 2022. The initial release in Go 1.18 is only the beginning. We need to spend time using generics and learning what works and what doesn’t, so that we can write best practices and decide what should be added to the standard library and other libraries. We expect that Go 1.19 (expected in August 2022) and later releases will further refine the design and implementation of generics as well as integrating them further into the overall Go experience.</span>

(1) 시간은 무한성과 자족성을 존재자에게 보장해 줄 수 없는 관계이다. (2) 시간은 사회성을 뜻하는 관계이다. (3) 시간은 존재자의 존재라는 존재의 지평이 아니라, 존재 저편의 방식으로, 즉 타자에 대한 사유 관계이다. (4) 시간은 타인의 얼굴.......</span>
