                    <span>Ceedling is still probably the best Test-Driven Development (TDD) environment for C programmers out there. But, as with many Free Open-Source Software ( FOSS ), tools getting it to work natively on a Windows environment involves the odd hoop-jumping exercise; either involving messing around with the likes of Cygwin or Mingw; or using a full Virtual Machine (VM) environment such as VirtualBox or VMware.
However, with the introduction of Windows-Subsystem-for-Linux (WSL) and the much-improved update to WSL2, running Linux centric FOSS [...]

                    <span>Developers worldwide are creating open-source tools and tutorials; however, they have difficulty getting them discovered. The content published often spanned on many different sites—from GitHub to Medium. Therefore Google decided to create a space where the best projects related to Google technologies can be highlighted in one place—introducing the Dev Library, a curated archive of projects and articles built specifically using Google technologies. 
Dev Library as a  platform showcases blog posts and open source tools with easy-to-use navigation for these product areas: Machine Learning, Flutter, Firebase, Angular, Cloud, and Android.

                    <span>Among the many new features pulled into the mainline during the 5.15 merge
window is the ksmbd
network filesystem server.  Ksmbd implements the SMB protocol
(also known as CIFS, though that name has gone out of favor) that is
heavily used in the Windows world.  The creation of an in-kernel SMB server
is a bit surprising, given that Linux has benefited greatly from the
user-space Samba solution since
shortly after the
beginning.  There are reasons for this move but, in the short term at
least, they risk being overshadowed by a worrisome stream of
security-related problems in ksmbd.</span>

                    <span>Sasha Levin, one of the maintainers of the stable kernels, gave a
presentation at
Open
Source Summit North America 2021 on a proposal for a different way to
handle the stable tree.   He noted that throughout most of the kernel&#x27;s history,
version numbers did not really mean anything, but that the versioning
scheme suggests that they do, which leads to a disconnect between how the
kernels are seen versus how they are actually maintained.  He proposed
making a &quot;rolling stable&quot; release that 
provides users what they need—timely fixes to their kernel—without forcing
them to choose to switch to a new version number.</span>

                    <span>Those of us developing software don’t need to be told what a big impact it’s had on humanity this century. I’ve long maintained that this places a serious responsibility on our profession. Whether asked to or not, we have a duty to ensure our systems don’t degrade our society. But in the tumult of so many software projects, it can be difficult to step back and understand the implications of our work. In the last few months my colleagues at Thoughtworks have been putting together a catalog of techniques that we can use to address this problem, which they published as the Responsible Tech Playbook.

The playbook is a free PDF download of about 50 slides, the bulk of which is a summary of a dozen tools and methods that teams can use to better understand their responsibilities. Each summary is…</span>

Google Workspace offers a broad set of tools and capabilities that empowers creators and developers of all experience levels to build a wide range of custom productivity solutions. For professional developers looking to integrate their own app experiences into Workspace, the platform enables deep integrations with frameworks like Google Workspace Add-ons and Chat apps, as well as deep access to the full suite of Google Workspace apps via numerous REST APIs. And for citizen developers on the business side or developers looking to build solutions quickly and easily, tools like Apps Script and AppSheet make it simple to customize, extend, and automate workflows directly within Google Workspace.

report on its goal of running Linux on Mac M1 hardware.

Earlier this year we saw the absolute lowest level drivers being merged into the kernel. Those are important for bring-up, but to get a usable system we need many more. Over September we’ve seen a lot of action on this front, with many important drivers now in review or even already merged for Linux 5.16. The goal of the Asahi Linux project is to upstream everything into the Linux kernel, so all our drivers are eventually headed for upstream review.</span>

                    <span>Developers working in languages like C or C++ have access to
two competing compilers — GCC and LLVM — either of which can usually get
the job done.  Rust developers, though, are currently limited to the
LLVM-based rustc compiler.  While rustc works well, there
are legitimate reasons for developers to wish for an alternative.  As it
turns out, there are two different ways to compile Rust using GCC under
development, though neither is ready at the moment.  Developers of both
approaches came to the 2021 Linux
Plumbers Conference to present the status of their work.</span>

                    <span>When you start to build web applications with Go, one of the first questions you&#x27;ll probably ask is &quot;which
    router should I use?&quot;. 
It&#x27;s not an easy question to answer, either. There are probably more than 100 different routers
        available, all with different APIs, features, and behaviors. So for this blog post I&#x27;ve evaluated 30 popular
        ones, and created a shortlist of the best options along with a flowchart that you can use to help guide your choice.
    
Note: If you don&#x27;t want to read the discussion, you can skip to the flowchart.
    
Before we start, a few notes on terminology:
By supports method-based routing I mean that the router makes it easy to dispatch a HTTP
        request to different handlers based on the request method (&quot;GET&quot;,
        &quot;POST&quot;, etc).

                    <span>The 5.15-rc4 kernel prepatch is out for
testing.


	One thing standing out in the diffs might be the m68k &#x27;set_fs()&#x27;
	removal - not really a regression fix, but it has been pending for
	a while, and it turned out that the problems attributed to it were
	due to an entirely unrelated m68k signal handling issue. So with
	that fixed, we could get rid of set_fs from another architecture.


See this article for information on
set_fs() and its removal.</span>

                    <span>Paul McKenney has started a blog series on Rust for the Linux kernel.  He has posted six of a planned 11 articles, though several are labeled as &quot;under construction&quot;.

This series focuses mostly on use cases and opportunities, rather than on any non-trivial solutions. Please note that I am not in any way attempting to dictate or limit Rust&#x27;s level of ambition. I am instead noting the memory-model consequences of a few potential levels of ambition, ranging from &quot;portions of a few drivers&quot;, &quot;a few drivers&quot;, &quot;some core code&quot; and up to and including &quot;the entire kernel&quot;. Greater levels of ambition will require greater willingness to accommodate a wider variety of LKMM [Linux-kernel memory model] requirements.

[...]
These blog posts will therefore present approaches ranging upwards from trivial workarounds. But be warned that some of the high-quality approaches require profound reworking of compiler backends that have thus far failed to spark joy in the hearts of compiler writers. In addition, Rust enjoys considerable use outside of the Linux kernel, for example, as something into which to rewrite inefficient Python scripts. (A megawatt here, a megawatt there, and pretty soon you are talking about real power consumption!) Therefore, there are probably sharp limits beyond which the core Rust developers are unwilling to go.</span>

아이폰의 메모리를 덤프하고 프로세스 메모리를 분석하는 작업을 수행해보자.


frida 설치(Jailbreaken iOS Device)
탈옥한 아이폰에는 기본적으로 시디아(cydia)가 설치되어 있다. 일종의 앱스토어인데 그 안에서 frida를 검색하여 설치하자.
위의 설치는 탈옥한 아이폰에서 진행한 것이다. 그렇다면 이제 아이폰과 연결할 컴퓨터에서도 frida를 설치해야 연동할 수 있다.
나의 경우 macOS에서 아래의 명령어로 설치했다.
$ pip install --upgrade pip
$ pip install frida
$ pip install frida-tools
이제 mac과 iphone을 USB 방식으로 연결을 한다.
그리고 mac에서 다음의 명령어를 입력하면 현재 수행중인 프로세스 목록을 볼 수 있으며, pid 번호도 보인다.

                    <span>Posted by Sarah Fullmer, Program Manager
     
The Flutter Meetup Network (FMN) is an international network of Meetup groups united by their enthusiasm for Flutter. The FMN program mission is to foster a thriving worldwide community of Flutter developers by empowering community organizers to educate and inspire local communities with engaging events.
Meetups – and similar developer community groups - are a great resource. As Flutter has grown in popularity over the past few years, over 100 Meetup groups have sprung up organically around the world to celebrate and educate their members about Flutter. The volunteers who run these groups have hosted many awesome events and workshops. 
    
We, in the Flutter team, see and appreciate these amazing communities. 💙 The Flutter Meetup Network (FMN) is now being launched to support these groups officially. Network members will have access to various resources (more details available soon!), making it easier to plan and host Flutter-themed events. 
Meetups have many benefits, aside from networking. When stuck on an issue in your current Flutter project, chances are good that you can find a developer in your local Flutter Meetup who has solved a similar problem. Or, maybe they know the perfect package for your needs. 
We are thrilled to support our amazing and passionate organizers and can’t wait to see what the Flutter Meetup Network does moving forward.

                    <span>Much of the free-software development world has adopted Git forges (such as
GitHub, GitLab, or sourcehut) with enthusiasm.  The kernel community has
not.  Reasons for that reticence vary, but one that is often heard is that
these forges simply don&#x27;t work well at the scale needed for the kernel
project.  At a
Kernel-Summit session during the 2021 
Linux Plumbers conference, Donald Zickus and Prarit Bhargava sought to
show how Red Hat has put GitLab to good use to support its kernel team.
Not only can these forges work for kernel development, they said, but
moving to a forge can bring a number of advantages.</span>

                    <span>Posted by Toni Klopfenstein, Developer Relations Engineer 
  
Today there are over 276 million smart home households globally, and the industry continues to see rapid growth every year. Users have never been more comfortable bringing home new smart home devices — but they also continue to expect more from their devices, and their smart homes. To meet and exceed these expectations,   we want to make sure developers have the tools and support to build their best experience across the Google Home app, Nest, Android, and Assistant.  
That’s why we’re excited to announce the return of the Google Smart Home Developer Summit on October 21, 2021! This year’s event is free to join, fully virtual and will be hosted on our website with broadcast times available for our developer communities in the AMER, EMEA, and APAC regions. 
To kick things off, Michele Turner, Senior Director of Product for Google’s Smart Home Ecosystem, will share our vision for the home and preview upcoming tools and features to build your next devices and apps using Matter and Thread — technologies transforming the industry. This will be followed by a developer keynote to dig deeper into announcements, and a round of technical sessions, workshops, and more, hosted by Google&#x27;s smart home leaders. 
Building the best smart home platform means using trusted technology and intelligence to develop your integrations faster, provide tools to drive your innovation, and allow you new paths to growth. We can’t wait to engage with you and share more about how we can lead and grow the smart home together. 
You can register for the Google Smart Home Developer Summit 2021 here, and follow along with the event using the tag #GoogleHomeSummit on social media. We hope to see you there!</span>

This is crucial to the growth and sustainability of any web3 project. Yet designing reputation systems requires complex considerations around reputation supply, distribution, credibility, and more.

                    <span>Adrian Ratiu writes
on the Collabora blog
about the challenges that face developers trying to build the GNU C
Library with the LLVM compiler.


	Is it worth it to fix glibc (and other projects which support only
	GCC) to build with LLVM? Is it better to just replace them with
	alternatives already supporting LLVM? Is it best to use both GCC
	and LLVM, each for their respective supported projects?

	This post is an exploration starting from these questions but does
	not attempt to give any definite answers. The intent here is to not
	be divisive and controversial, but to raise awareness by describing
	parts of the current status-quo and to encourage collaboration.</span>

                    <span>James Bottomley explains
how the integration of Matrix and BigBlueButton was done for the
just-concluded Linux Plumbers Conference.


	One thing that emerged from our initial disaster with Matrix on the
	first day is that we failed to learn from the experiences of other
	open source conferences (i.e. FOSDEM, which used Matrix and ran
	into the same problems). So, an object of this post is to document
	for posterity what we did and how to repeat it.</span>

                    <span>The term &quot;interrupt&quot; brings to mind a signal that originates in the
hardware and which is handled in the kernel; even software interrupts are a
kernel concept.  But there is, it seems, a use case for enabling user-space
processes to send interrupts directly to each other.  An upcoming Intel
processor generation includes support for this capability; at the 2020 Linux Plumbers Conference,
Sohil Mehta ran a
Kernel-Summit session on how Linux might support that feature.</span>

Android Dev Summit is back, October 27-28
Directly from the team who builds Android, the Android Dev Summit returns this year on October 27-28. Join us to hear about the latest updates in Android development, centered on this year’s theme: excellent apps, across devices. We have over 30 sessions on a range of technical Android development topics. Plus, we’ve assembled the team that builds Android to get your burning #AskAndroid questions answered live. Interested in learning more? Be sure to sign up for updates through our Android newsletter here. 
Discover, Connect, Inspire at Chrome Dev Summit 2021
The countdown to Chrome Dev Summit 2021 is on — and we can’t wait to share what we have in store. We’ll kick things off on November 3 by sharing the latest product updates in our keynote and hosting a live ask me anything (AMA) with Chrome leaders. You’ll also have the chance to chat live with Googlers and developers around the world, participate in workshops with industry experts, attend interactive learning lounges to consult with engineers in a group setting, and receive personalized support during one-on-one office hours. Everyone can tune into the keynote and AMA, but space is limited for the workshops, office hours, and learning lounges. Request an invite to secure your spot — we’ll see you on November 3! 
And follow the Firebase Twitter channel for more updates on Firebase Summit, which will be coming to you on November 10!</span>

Introduction
 Since its original launch in 2008, many of the core Google App Engine services such as Datastore, Memcache, and Blobstore, have matured to become their own standalone products: for example, Cloud Datastore, Cloud Memorystore, and Cloud Storage, respectively. The same is true for App Engine Task Queues with Cloud Tasks. Today&#x27;s Module 7 episode of Serverless Migration Station reviews how App Engine push tasks work, by adding this feature to an existing App Engine ndb Flask app.

That app is where we left off at the end of Module 1, migrating its web framework from App Engine webapp2 to Flask. The app registers web page visits, creating a Datastore Entity for e…</span>

                    <span>Work toward the signing of BPF programs has
been finding its way into recent mainline kernel releases; it is intended
to improve security by limiting the BPF programs that can be successfully
loaded into the kernel.  As John Fastabend described in his &quot;Watching
the super powers&quot; session at the 2021 Linux Plumbers Conference,
this new feature has the potential to completely break his tools.  But
rather than just complain, he decided to investigate solutions; the result
is an outline for an auditing mechanism that brings greater flexibility to
the problem of controlling which programs can be run.</span>

내가 컴퓨터공학 학부 2학년을 다니던 2009년 즈음, 전공 2학년 때 배우는 객체지향 프로그래밍 시간에는 C++을 배웠었다. 서점에 갔는데, C/C++ 및 자료구조의 &#x27;열혈 프로그래밍&#x27; 시리즈로 유명한 윤성우님이 JAVA 프로그래밍 책을 출간하셨다. 놀랍게도 제목은 [난 정말 JAVA를 공부한 적이 없다구요]였다(이 책은 현재 &#x27;열혈 Java 프로그래밍&#x27;으로 개정되어 출간되었다). 그 당시 잠시 책을 살펴보긴 했지만, C++과는 코딩 스타일이 너무 다르다는 생각에 우선은 배우기를 보류했던 기억이 난다. 그런데 내가 졸업하고 몇 년 뒤부터는 학부과정 수업이 JAVA로 바뀌었다는 소식을 전해 들었다. 결과적으로 나는 JAVA를 배운 적이 없었다.
학교를 졸업하고 군대에 가서 프로그래밍을 할 일이 많았는데, 물론 대다수의 공공기관은 전자정부 표준프레임워크 사용에 따라 JAVA를 사용할 일이 많았다. 하지만 난 여전히 C/C++을 선호하던 관성을 따르고 싶었기에 꼭 필요한 경우가 아니면 JAVA를 회피했다. 현재의 나는 주로 Python을 사용하고 golang도 배우고 있지만 이상하게도 아직까지 굳이 JAVA를 직접적으로 사용할 일은 극히 드문 상황이다. 어쩌면 내가 의도적으로 피했기 때문은 아닐까 하는 생각도 들었다. 다른 프로그래밍 언어를 알고 있으므로, 남이 작성한 자바 코드를 보고 어느 정도 읽고 이해하고 약간 수정할 줄은 알지만, 굳이 JAVA를 사용하여 프로그램을 만들고 싶은 적은 없었던 것이다.

Introduction

Google Cloud offers three distinct ways of running your code or application in a serverless way, each serving different use cases. Google App Engine, our first Cloud product, was created to give users the ability to deploy source-based web applications or mobile backends directly to the cloud without the need of thinking about servers or scaling. Cloud Functions came later for scenarios where you may not have an entire app, great for one-off utility functions or event-driven microservices. Cloud Run is our latest fully-managed serverless product that gives developers the flexibility of containers along with the convenience of serverless. 
As all are serverless compute platforms, users recognize they share so…</span>

                    <span>A controversy about the handling of the Time Zone Database (tzdb) has
been brewing since May, but has come to a head in recent weeks.  
Changes that were proposed to simplify the main database file have some
consequences in terms of time-zone history and changes to the
representation of some zones.  Those changes have upset a number of users
of the database—to the point where some have called for a fork.  A 
September 25 release of tzdb with some, but not
all, of the changes seems unlikely to resolve the conflict.</span>

competition &quot;Youth Hacking 4 Freedom&quot; (YH4F) for European teenagers
(14-18).  Six winners will receive a cash prize and a trip to Brussels.
There will be an opening event October 10 and registration will remain open
until October 31.

On Monday 1 November 2021, a five-month coding phase starts and the participants focus on coding until March 2022. Participants may bring all their imagination to the competition; they may code any type of software they want, as long as it is Free Software. The software project can be a stand-alone program written from scratch, or you can modify or combine existing programs. Everything is welcome! The participants will have the chance to briefly follow each other’s work and exchange ideas.</span>

Google Developer Group (GDG) chapters are in a unique position to help make an impact during a time where many companies and businesses are trying to shift to a digital first world. Perhaps no one knows this better than GDG NYC Lead, Anna Nerezova. Over the past year, she’s seen firsthand just how powerful the GDG NYC community can be when the right opportunity presents itself. 

GDG NYC levels up their Google Cloud skills

In the past few years, Anna and other GDG NYC organizers have hosted a number of events focused on learning and sharing Cloud technologies with community members, including Cloud Study Jams and in-person workshops on Machine Learning Cloud-Speech-to-Text, Natural Language Processing, and more.

                    <span>The Kernel Maintainers Summit is an invitation-only gathering of top-level
kernel subsystem maintainers; it is concerned mostly with process-oriented
issues that are not easily worked out on the mailing lists.  There was no
maintainers summit in 2020; plans had been made to hold it in an electronic
form, but there turned out to be a lack of things to talk about.  In 2021,
though, a number of interesting topics turned up, so an online gathering
was held on September 24 as part of the Linux Plumbers Conference.

                    <span>Smart pointers available since C++11 are an essential foundation for writing secure code in Modern C++. Thanks to RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization), they allow you to work with pointers to allocate memory or other managed objects efficiently.
This blog post will show you the core points for working with those handy types.

                    <span>When I was 15 or so, my father would drive me, and my best friend, Tim Conrad, to the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) sales office each Saturday.  This was a 30 min drive.  My father would drop us off in the morning and pick us up in the late afternoon.  He spend two hours in his car each Saturday hauling us around.
Thanks Dad!
Tim and I would spend our day &quot;playing&quot; with the floor model of the PDP-8 they had at the office.  The office staff were very accommodating and accepting of our presence, and they helped us out if we needed any fresh rolls of teleprinter paper, or paper tape.
Several years later, at the age of 20, I found myself working at Teradyne Applied Systems in Chicago.  The computer we used there was called an M365; but it was really just an upgraded PDP-8.  We used it to…</span>

                    <span>It has often been said that the competition between the GCC and LLVM
compilers is good for both of them.  One place where that competition 
shows up is in the area of security features; if one compiler adds a way to
harden programs, the other is likely to follow suit.  Qing
Zhao&#x27;s session at the 2021
Linux Plumbers Conference told the story of how GCC successfully played
catch-up for two security-related features that were of special interest to
the kernel community.</span>

cp has changed how it handles data

     
enables CoW [copy on write] by default (through FICLONE ioctl),
     
uses copy offload where available (through copy_file_range),

                    <span>Here&#x27;s a
lengthy missive from Lennart Poettering taking Linux distributors to
task for inadequately protecting systems from physical attacks.


	So, does the scheme so far implemented by generic Linux
	distributions protect us against the latter two scenarios?
	Unfortunately not at all. Because distributions set up disk
	encryption the way they do, and only bind it to a user password, an
	attacker can easily duplicate the disk, and then attempt to brute
	force your password. What&#x27;s worse: since code authentication ends
	at the kernel — and the initrd is not authenticated anymore —,
	backdooring is trivially easy: an attacker can change the initrd
	any way they want, without having to fight any kind of protections.

Yara Elkady, Google Developer Student Club (GDSC) Lead, can trace her passion for tech all the way back to a single moment. She was sitting in computer class when her middle school teacher posed a question to the class: 

“Did you know that you can create apps and games like the ones that you spend so much time on?”

It was a simple question, but it was enough to plant the seed that would define the trajectory of Yara’s career. Following in the footsteps of so many beginners before her, Yara did a Google search to find out more about creating apps. She didn’t realize it at the time, but Yara had just taken her first steps down the path to becoming a developer. 
Knowing that she wanted to pursue tech further, Yara went to c…</span>

                    <span>Over at the Guix-HPC blog, Ludovic Courtès writes about trying to package the PyTorch machine-learning library for the Guix distribution.  Building from source in a user-verifiable manner is part of the philosophy behind Guix, but there were a number of problems that were encountered:

The first surprise when starting packaging PyTorch is that, despite being on PyPI, PyTorch is first and foremost a large C++ code base. It does have a setup.py as commonly found in pure Python packages, but that file delegates the bulk of the work to CMake.

The second surprise is that PyTorch bundles (or &quot;vendors&quot;, as some would say) source code for no less than 41 dependencies, ranging from small Python and C++ helper libraries to large C++ neural network tools. Like other distributions such as Debian, Guix avoids bundling: we would rather have one Guix package for each of these dependencies. The rationale is manifold, but it boils down to keeping things auditable, reducing resource usage, and making security updates practical.</span>

at the 2021 Linux
Plumbers Conference would be focused rather differently.  But, as we reported earlier in September, his folio patch set ran into some, perhaps
unexpected, opposition and, ultimately, did not land in the mainline for
5.15.  Instead of discussing how to use folios as part
of the File
Systems microconference, he led a discussion that was, at least in part, on the
path forward for them.</span>

some of the &quot;little things&quot; featured in the upcoming PostgreSQL 14
release.


	And now in PostgreSQL 14 there is this seemingly small update,
	pipeline mode, which, according to the docs, allows applications to
	send a query without having to read the result of the previously
	sent query.  Taking advantage of the pipeline mode, a client will
	wait less for the server, since multiple queries/results can be
	sent/received in a single network transaction.</span>

                    <span>The Google security blog provides
an overview of what is being done to address memory-safety problems in
the Chrome browser.


	In parallel, we’ll be exploring whether we can use a memory safe
	language for parts of Chrome in the future. The leading contender
	is Rust, invented by our friends at Mozilla. This is (largely)
	compile-time safe; that is, the Rust compiler spots mistakes with
	pointers before the code even gets to your device, and thus there’s
	no performance penalty. Yet there are open questions about whether
	we can make C++ and Rust work well enough together. Even if we
	started writing new large components in Rust tomorrow, we’d be

 Long gone are the days of looking for documentation, finding a how-to guide, and questioning whether the commands and code samples actually work. 
Google Cloud recently added a Cloud Shell integration within each and every documentation page. 
This new functionality lets you test code in a preprovisioned virtual machine instance while learning about Google Cloud services. Running commands and code from the documentation cuts down on context switching between the documentation and a terminal window to run the commands in a tutorial. 
This gif shows how Google Cloud’s documentation uses Cloud Shell, letting you run commands in a quickstart within your Cloud Shell environment.

                    <span>Alyssa Rosenzweig reports
that the open-source Panfrost driver for Mali GPUs has achieved official
conformance on Mali-G52 for OpenGL ES 3.1.

This important milestone is a step forward for the open source driver, as it now certifies Panfrost for use in commercial products containing Mali G52 and paves the way for further conformance submissions on other Mali GPUs.</span>

                    <span>Middleboxes are,
unfortunately in many ways, a big part of today&#x27;s internet.  While middleboxes
inhabit the same physical niche as routers, they are not aimed at packet forwarding;
instead they are meant to monitor and manipulate the packets that they
see.  The effects of those devices on users of the networks they reign over may be
unfortunate as well, but the rest of the internet is only affected when
trying to communicate with those users—or so it was thought.  Based on some
recently reported research, it turns out that middleboxes can be abused to 
inflict denial-of-service (DoS) attacks elsewhere on the net.</span>

 Google Developers Experts is a global community of developers, engineers and thought leaders who passionately share their technical knowledge with others.  
Becoming a Google Developers Expert is no easy task. First, you need to have strong skills in one of the technical areas - Android, Kotlin, Google Cloud, Machine Learning, Web Technologies, Angular, Firebase, Google Workspace, Flutter or other. You also need to have a track record of sharing your knowledge - be it via conference talks, your personal blog, youtube videos or in some other form. Finally, you need one more thing. The courage to approach an existing Expert or a Google employee and ask them to support your application. 
It’s not easy, but it’s worth it. Joining the Experts community comes…</span>

                    <span>Ben Hoyt has published a critical
overview of the Python 3.10 pattern-matching feature.


	As shown above, there are cases where match really
	shines. But they are few and far between, mostly when handling
	syntax trees and writing parsers. A lot of code does have
	if ... elif chains, but these are often either
	plain switch-on-value, where elif works almost as well, or
	the conditions they’re testing are a more complex combination of
	tests that don’t fit into case patterns (unless you use awkward
	case _ if cond clauses, but that’s strictly worse than
	elif).

well).</span>

So I&#x27;ve spent a fair amount of this week trying to sort out all the
odd warnings, and I want to particularly thank Guenter Roeck for his
work on tracking where the build failures due to -Werror come from.

Is it done? No. But on the whole I&#x27;m feeling fairly good about this
all, even if it has meant that I&#x27;ve been looking at some really odd
and grotty code. Who knew I&#x27;d still worry about some odd EISA driver
on alpha, after all these years? A slight change of pace ;)</span>

In this article, you’ll see a practical example from the robotics area where the vocabulary types from C++17 play important roles.

                    <span>Here&#x27;s a
post from Christian Schaller describing a number of the
desktop-oriented improvements that can be expected in the Fedora 35
release.


	And I know some people will wonder why we spent so much time
	working with NVidia around their binary driver, but the reality is
	that NVidia is the market leader, especially in the professional
	Linux workstation space, and there are lot of people who either
	would end up not using Linux or using Linux with X without it,
	including a lot of Red Hat customers and Fedora users. And that is
	what I and my team are here for at the end of the day, to make sure
	Red Hat customers are able to get their job done using their Linux
	systems.</span>

                    <span>Ariadne Conill looks
at the difficulties caused by the OpenSSL 3 transition in the
context of Alpine Linux.


	For distributions, however, the story is different:
	cryptography moved to using Rust, because they wanted to
	leverage all of the static analysis capabilities built into the
	language.  This, too, is a reasonable decision, from a development
	perspective.  From the ecosystem perspective, however, it is
	problematic, as the Rust ecosystem is still rapidly evolving, and
	so we cannot support a single branch of the Rust compiler for an
	entire 2 year lifecycle, which means it exists in community.  Our
	solution, historically, has been to hold cryptography at
	the latest version that did not require Rust to build.  However,
	that version is not compatible with OpenSSL 3, and so it will
	eventually need to be upgraded to a new version which is.  And so,
	since cryptography has to move to community, so does
	paramiko and Ansible.</span>

introducing the effort to bring the Rust programming language into the

to presenting the Rust language itself with an emphasis on what Rust can
provide for kernel development.  The result was a useful resource for

                    <span>C++20 Coroutines
There seems to be a lot of confusion around the implementation of C++20 coroutines, which I think is due to the draft technical specification for C++20 stating that coroutines are a work in progress so we can’t expect full compiler and library support at this point in time.
A lot of the problems probably arise from the lack of official documentation about working with coroutines. We have been given C++ syntax support for coroutines (the co_yield and co_return) but without [...]

                    <span>This article was discussed on Hacker News.
Years ago, OpenBSD gained two new security system calls, pledge(2)
(originally tame(2)) and unveil. In both, an application
surrenders capabilities at run-time. The idea is to perform initialization
like usual, then drop capabilities before handling untrusted input,
limiting unwanted side effects. This feature is applicable even where type
safety isn’t an issue, such as Python, where a program might still get
tricked into accessing sensitive files or making network connections when
it shouldn’t. So how can a Python program access these system calls?
As discussed previously, it’s quite easy to access C APIs from
Python through its ctypes package, and this is no exception.

Roundup,
version 2.1.0, was
released in July; it is a maintenance release, but there have been a number
of larger improvements in the last year or so. Here we introduce

                    <span>My friend over at Possibly Wrong created a code name generator. By
coincidence I happened to be thinking about code names myself while
recently replaying XCOM: Enemy Within (2012/2013). The game
generates a random code name for each mission, and I wondered how often it
repeats. The UFOpaedia page on the topic gives the word lists: 53
adjectives and 76 nouns, for a total of 4028 possible code names. A
typical game has around 60 missions, and if code names are generated
naively on the fly, then per the birthday paradox around half of all games
will see a repeated mission code name! Fortunately this is easy to avoid,
and the particular configuration here lends itself to an interesting
implementation.
Mission code names are built using “adjective noun”. Some examples
from the game’s word list:…</span>

How the idea emerged
With the advancement of technology, drones have become not only smaller, but also have more compute. There are many examples of iPhone-sized quadcopters in the consumer drone market and the computing power to do live tracking while recording 4K video. However, the most important element has not changed much - the controller. It is still bulky and not intuitive for beginners to use. There is a smartphone with on-display control as an option; however, the control principle is still the same.  
That is how the idea for this project emerged: a more personalised approach t…</span>

	So 5.15 isn&#x27;t shaping up to be a particularly large release, at
	least in number of commits. At only just over 10k non-merge
	commits, this is in fact the smallest rc1 we have had in the 5.x
	series. We&#x27;re usually hovering in the 12-14k commit range.

	That said, counting commits isn&#x27;t necessarily the best measure, and

                    <span>Two keywords, constexpr and virtual - can those two work together? Virtual implies runtime polymorphism, while constexpr suggests constant expression evaluation. It looks like we have a contradiction, does it?
Read on and see why those conflicting terms might help us get simpler code.
A basic example
Imagine that you work with some product list, and you want to check if a product fits in a given box size:
#include 

struct Box {
  double width{0.0};
  double height{0.0};
  double length{0.0};
};

struct Product {
  virtual ~Product() &#x3D; default;

  virtual Box getBox() const noexcept &#x3D; 0;

                    <span>The Linux Foundation has announced that  Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX) has become an international standard (ISO/IEC 5962:2021).  SPDX has been used in the kernel and other projects to identify the licenses and attach other metadata to  software components.

Between eighty and ninety percent (80%-90%) of a modern application is assembled from open source software components. An SBOM [software bill of materials] accounts for the software components contained in an application — open source, proprietary, or third-party — and details their provenance, license, and security attributes. SBOMs are used as a part of a foundational practice to track and trace components across software supply chains. SBOMs also help to proactively identify software issues and risks and establish a starting point for their remediation.

SPDX results from ten years of collaboration from representatives across industries, including the leading Software Composition Analysis (SCA) vendors – making it the most robust, mature, and adopted SBOM standard.</span>

track to be pulled into the mainline during the 5.15 merge window.  Matthew
Wilcox duly sent a pull
request in August to make that happen.  While it is possible that
folios could still end up in 5.15, that has not happened as of this writing
and appears increasingly unlikely.  What we got instead was a lengthy
discussion on the merits of the folio approach.</span>

                    <span>This blog post by
Loris Cro makes the claim that the Zig
language  is
the solution to a lot of low-level programming problems:


	Freeing the art of systems programming from the grips of C/C++
	cruft is the only way to push for real change in our industry, but
	rewriting everything is not the answer. In the Zig project we’re
	making the C/C++ ecosystem more fun and productive. Today we have a
	compiler, a linker and a build system, and soon we’ll also have a
	package manager, making Zig a complete toolchain that can fetch
	dependencies and build C/C++/Zig projects from any target, for any
	target.

                    <span>The Linux extended-attribute mechanism allows the attachment of metadata to
files within a filesystem.  It tends to be little used — at least, in the
absence of a security module like SELinux.  There is interest in how these
attributes work, though, as evidenced by the discussions that have
followed the posting of revisions of this
patch by Vivek Goyal, which seeks to make a seemingly small change to
the rules regarding extended attributes and special files.</span>
