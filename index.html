another year — LWN&#x27;s 22nd year of publication.  That can only mean one
thing: it is time to take a look back at our
ill-advised attempt to make predictions in January and see how it all
worked out.  Shockingly, some of those predictions were at least partially
on the mark.  Others were ... not quite so good.</span>

                    <span>Back at the beginning of 2020, it was predicted that retirements would increase
during this decade.  In 2021, the prediction
was that retirements would increase over the next couple of years. It is
happening and LWN is no exception.  I am retiring at the end of this year
after more than 20 years with LWN.

So who am I and how did I get here?  To some, I&#x27;m a name at the bottom of
some LWN page. To a few, I&#x27;m the one that reminds them when their LWN group
subscription is about to expire. You might have even met me at a
conference. Not that I have been to very many.  Mostly I tend to be quietly
in the background watching the LWN mailbox, looking for brief items and
quotes of the week (sorry I haven&#x27;t found much lately), proofreading
articles, managing subscriptions, and more. But I&#x27;m older than most of you
and this is my last LWN weekly edition.  Getting here is a bit of story.</span>

                    <span>Fedora is among the group of Linux distributions that, by default, lock
out the root account such that it does not have a password and cannot be
logged into.  But, traditionally, &quot;rescue mode&quot; boots the system into
single-user
mode, which requires a root password—difficult to provide if it 
does not exist.  A Fedora proposal to remove the need for the password in
that case, and just drop into a root shell, does not seem likely to go far
in that form,
but it would seem to have pointed toward some better solutions for the
underlying problem.</span>

                    <span>The Linux Foundation has announced
the posting of a report on its research into diversity, equity, and
inclusion in open-source communities.


The research shows that while
a majority of respondents feel welcome in open source, many in
underrepresented communities do not. We hope that the data and insights
that this project provides will be a catalyst for strengthening existing
DEI initiatives and creating new ones.

others.  The time of the switch to Manifest
V3, as the new API is known, is growing closer; privacy advocates are
concerned that it will preclude a number of techniques that browser
extensions use for features like ad and tracker blocking.  Part of the
concern stems from the fact that Google is both the developer of a popular
web browser and the operator of an enormous advertising network so its
incentives seem, at least, plausibly misaligned.</span>

Ning built his first website for his English class to help his classmates succeed with their studies. He didn’t realize it at the time, but he was only just getting started. Throughout high school, he played with Google Webmaster Tools (now Google Search Console) and Google Adsense to create and manage numerous other websites for fun. Like so many aspiring developers before him, Ning knew he’d found his passion, but the path ahead remained unclear.

	Regardless of what happens, I will be making an rc8 - not because

	seasonal holidays. There&#x27;s no point in releasing a final 5.16 and
	opening the merge window when people are still on holiday or just

The document is excerpted since much of the original doc was about comparing possible approaches to increasing efficency at Twitter, which is mostly information that&#x27;s meaningless outside of Twitter without a large amount of additional explanation/context.
At Twitter, most  CPU bound services start falling over at around 50% reserved container CPU utilization and almost all services start falling over at not much more CPU utilization even though CPU bound services should, theoretically, be able to get higher CPU utilizations. Because load isn&#x27;t, in general, evenly balanced across shards and the shard-level degradation in performance is so severe when we exceed 50% CPU utilization, this makes the prac…</span>

                    <span>Just in time for the upcoming holidays, &quot;KDE&#x27;s educational suite of more than 170 activities and pedagogical games&quot;, GCompris, has released version 2.0.  It includes new and updated games and activities, including:

Getting back to numeracy activities, GCompris 2.0 includes a wide range of activities that mimic basic manipulation math games, allowing young players to experiment with elements, grouping them in sets of up to ten items. This helps them build a clear concept of the decimal system, and, as with many GCompris activities, an educator can gradually increase the difficulty level, allowing the activities to be used with children of ages between 3 and 10. Once they grasp the concept of the decimal system, the addition and subtraction activities, also based on math manipulation, help practice arithmetic.

Along with other classics, like chess, align four, and checkers, fans of strategy games will enjoy Oware, a game that requires forethought and, again, numeracy skills. Oware is originally a traditional African pastime and can be played against a friend or against Tux, offering unlimited hours of fun.</span>

                    <span>The Google Security Blog looks
into the ripple effects of the Log4j vulnerability.


	Most artifacts that depend on log4j do so indirectly. The deeper
	the vulnerability is in a dependency chain, the more steps are
	required for it to be fixed. The following diagram shows a
	histogram of how deeply an affected log4j package (core or api)
	first appears in consumers dependency graphs. For greater than 80%
	of the packages, the vulnerability is more than one level deep,
	with a majority affected five levels down (and some as many as nine
	levels down). These packages will require fixes throughout all
	parts of the tree, starting from the deepest dependencies first.</span>

capable developers fear to tread; one of those is surely the code that
implements signals.  The nature of the signal API almost guarantees that
any implementation will be full of subtle interactions and complexities,
and the version in Linux doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  So the inclusion of a
signal-handling change late in the 5.16 merge window might have been
expected to have the potential for difficulties; it didn&#x27;t disappoint
either.</span>

                    <span>There&#x27;s a myth that open-source software is better and safer that the closed one. This was reasonably questioned many times. People regularly find epic vulnerabilities in the open source code. These vulnerabilities have been there for a long time. I think the project quality depends on how the development managers arrange the process and what methodologies/tools are used. It has nothing to do with the project being open source or closed source.</span>

 We&#x27;ve reached the end of the year - and what a year it&#x27;s been! Between all of our live (virtual) events including I/O, developer summits, meetups and more, there are a lot of highlights for App Actions, Smart Home Actions and Conversational Actions. Let&#x27;s dive in and take a look.  

App Actions
 App Actions allows developers to extend their Android App to Google Assistant. App Actions integrates more cleanly with Android using new Android platform features.

                    <span>Over the past 20 years, there has been a dramatic shift in capital flow from the public to private markets. Since 2000, private market assets have grown over 10 times, representing over $6 trillion globally. This trend has been driven by a variety of factors, including low interest rates, companies staying private longer, the need... Read More

vulnerability that has been making life miserable for system administrators
since its disclosure on December 9.  This bug is relatively easy to
exploit, results in remote code execution, and lurks on servers all across
the net; it is not hyperbolic to call it one of the worst vulnerabilities
that has been disclosed in some years.  In a sense, the lessons from Log4j
have little new to teach us, but this bug does highlight some problems in
the free-software ecosystem in an unambiguous way.</span>

                    <span>When last we looked in on the great typing PEP
debate for Python, back in August, two PEPs were still being
discussed as alternatives for handling annotations in the language.
The steering council was considering the issue after deferring on a
decision for the Python 3.10 release, but the question has been
deferred again for Python 3.11.  More study is needed and the council
is looking for help from the Python community to guide its
decision.  In the meantime, though, discussion about the deferral has led
to the understanding that annotations are not a general-purpose feature,
but are only meant for typing information.  In addition, there is a growing
realization that typing information is effectively becoming mandatory
for Python libraries.</span>

Some challenges affect everyone regardless of borders or nationality, and combating climate issues is no different. Aysu Keçeci, a student in Turkey with an avowed reverence for the sea, found herself increasingly distressed by the growing amount of plastic in the world’s oceans. She notes, “As an Aegean, the seas are a big part of my life, Unfortunately, I have grown up observing that our waters are polluted daily, and I know that plastics now make up 80% of marine garbage, and if we don&#x27;t take precautions, there will be more plastic in our seas than fish in 2050. That&#x27;s why plastic pollution has always been a problem I wanted to address.”

GAFAM이라 불리는 다섯 기업의 매출은 지난 해 3분기보다 40% 증가했고, 이익은 90%나 뛰었습니다. S&amp;P 500 정보통신(IT) 지수는 연일 신고가를 기록하며 상승하고 있습니다. 그러나 최근 실적이 정점이라고 보는 전문가들도 많습니다. → 더 보기</span>

 Recently, Google Workspace Marketplace launched new features for developers to improve the application search and evaluation experience in the Marketplace for our Google Workspace admins and end users.  
Continuing with updates to further improve the developer experience, we are excited to announce Google Workspace Marketplace badges.  
The new badges will allow developers to promote their published Google Workspace Marketplace applications on their own websites. Users will be taken directly to the Marketplace application listing, where they can review application details, privacy policy, terms of service, and more. These users will then be able to securely install applications directly from the Google Workspace Marketplace.

                    <span>Adding fs-verity file-integrity information
to RPM packages for Fedora 36 is the 
topic of a recent discussion on the Fedora devel mailing list.  The feature
would provide a means to install files from RPM packages as read-only files
that cannot be read or otherwise operated on if the data in the files changes
at any point.  The proposal is mostly about making the plumbing available
for use cases that are not particularly clear—which has led to some
questions and skepticism among those participating in the thread.</span>

                    <span>I see a lot of essays framed as writing advice which are actually thinly veiled descriptions of how someone writes that basically say &quot;you should write how I write&quot;, e.g., people who write short posts say that you should write short posts. As with technical topics, I think a lot of different things can work and what&#x27;s really important is that you find a style that&#x27;s suitable to you and the context you operate in. Copying what&#x27;s worked for someone else is unlikely to work for you, making &quot;write how I write&quot; bad advice.
We&#x27;ll start by looking at how much variety there&#x27;s been in what&#x27;s worked1 for people, come back to what makes it so hard to copy someone else&#x27;s style, and then discuss what I try to do in my writing.

                    <span>Email is often seen as a technology with a dim future; it is slow, easily
faked, and buried in spam.  Kids These Days want nothing to do with it, and
email has lost its charm with many others as well.
But many development projects are still dependent on it, and even
non-developers still cope with large volumes of mail.  While development
forges show one possible path away from email, they are not the only one.
What if new structures could be built on top of email to address some of
its worst problems while keeping the good parts that many projects depend
on?  The &quot;lei&quot; system recently launched by Konstantin Ryabitsev is a hint
of how such a future might look.</span>

against Manifest V3, a set of changes coming to a Chrome browser near
you.


	Manifest V3, or Mv3 for short, is outright harmful to privacy
	efforts. It will restrict the capabilities of web
	extensions—especially those that are designed to monitor, modify,
	and compute alongside the conversation your browser has with the
	websites you visit. Under the new specifications, extensions like

testing.


Do give it a good testing - with the holidays coming up, things are
probably going to slow down both on the development and testing front,
and as a result I expect that I will also extend the rc series by
another week not because it&#x27;s necessarily needed (too early to tell,
but doesn&#x27;t feel that way), but simply because nobody will want to
open the next merge window immediately in the new year.


One small change of note in this -rc is that the default limit for the
number of pages that can be locked into memory by an unprivileged process
has been raised to
8MB; see this article for a summary of the
discussions leading up to this change.</span>

                    <span>In this blog post, I’d like to show you examples of several handy “map” functions from Modern C++. Associative containers like std::map, std::set, and their “unordered” counterparts are essential for many algorithms and techniques. With this new functionality, you can save the creation of temporary objects, write smaller and, what’s more, safer code.
Background code
To illustrate all the mechanics of a map, especially in terms of what happens with our objects, I have the following helper custom class:
struct User {
    std::string name {&quot;default&quot;};
    
    User() {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;User::User() &quot; &lt;&lt; name &lt;&lt; &#x27;\n&#x27;;

    explicit User(std::string str) : name(std::move(str)) {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;User::User(std::string str) &quot; &lt;&lt; name &lt;&lt; &#x27;\n&#x27;;

                    <span>For those who have not yet seen it, this
advisory from Apache describes a nasty vulnerability in the widely used
Log4j package.


	Apache Log4j2 &lt;&#x3D;2.14.1 JNDI features used in configuration, log
	messages, and parameters do not protect against attacker controlled
	LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. An attacker who can control
	log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code
	loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is
	enabled. From log4j 2.15.0, this behavior has been disabled by
	default.


Updating this package is, of course, necessary, but that will only help so
much; it is bundled into a lot of other deployed products.
For more information see
this
Ars Technica article or, for desperate cases,

                    <span>Guido van Rossum has posted the sad news that longtime Python
contributor Fredrik Lundh has died.


	Fredrik was an early Python contributor (e.g. Elementtree and the
	&#x27;re&#x27; module) and his enthusiasm for the language and community were
	inspiring for all who encountered him or his work. He spent
	countless hours on comp.lang.python answering questions from
	newbies and advanced users alike.

	He also co-founded an early Python startup, Secret Labs AB, which
	among other software released an IDE named PythonWorks. Fredrik
	also created the Python Imaging Library (PIL) which is still THE
	way to interact with images in Python, now most often through its
	Pillow fork. His effbot.org site was a valuable resource for
	generations of Python users, especially its Tkinter documentation.</span>

                    <span>The &quot;Meta for Developers&quot; blog has an
introduction to the drgn kernel debugger.


	drgn (pronounced “dragon”) is a debugger that exposes the types and
	variables in a program for easy, expressive scripting in
	Python. The Linux kernel team at Meta originally built drgn to make
	it easier to investigate the kinds of difficult Linux kernel bugs
	that the team encounters at Meta. The team has since added further
	use cases for it, like monitoring and userspace memory profiling.


LWN reported on drgn in 2019.</span>

                    <span>Regressions are no fun; among other things, finding the source of a
regression among thousands of changes can be a needle-in-the-haystack sort
of problem.  The git
bisect 
command can help; it is a (relatively) easy way to sift through 
large numbers of commits to find the one that introduces a regression.  When it
works well, it can quickly point out the change that causes a specific
problem.  Bisection is not a perfect tool, though; it can go badly wrong in
situations where a bug cannot be reliably reproduced.  In an attempt to
make bisection more useful in such cases, Jan Kara is proposing to add &quot;stochastic
bisection&quot; support to Git.</span>

                    <span>PostgreSQL developer Robert Haas has begun
a blog series on what would be needed to allow database administrators
to safely delegate superuser powers.


	Consider, for example, the case of a service provider who would
	like to support a database with multiple customers as tenants. The
	customers will naturally want to feel as if they have the powers of
	a true superuser, with the ability to do things like create new
	roles, drop old ones, change permissions on objects that they don&#x27;t
	own, and generally enjoy the freedom to bypass permission checks at
	the SQL level which superusers enjoy. The service provider, who is
	the true superuser, also wants this, but does not want the
	customers to be able to do the really scary things that a superuser
	can do, like changing archive_command to
	rm -rf / or deleting the 
	entire contents of pg_proc so that the system crashes and the
	database in which the operation was performed is permanently
	ruined.</span>

                    <span>Feature deprecations are often controversial, but many projects find it
necessary, or desirable, to lose some of the baggage that has accreted over
time.  A mid-November request to get rid of three Python standard library
modules provides a case in point.  It was initially greeted as a good idea
since the modules had been officially deprecated starting with
Python 3.6; there are better ways to accomplish their
tasks now.  But, of course, removing a module breaks any project that uses
it, at least without the project making some, perhaps even trivial,
changes.  The cost of that is not insignificant, and the value in doing so
is not always clear, which led to higher-level conversation about deprecations.</span>

of attention (and work) for what is, or seemingly should be, a fairly small
component of the kernel.  In part that is because random numbers, and
their quality, are extremely important to a number of security
protections, from unpredictable IP-packet sequence numbers to cryptographic
keys.  A recent post of
version 43 of the Linux Random Number 
Generator (LRNG) by Stephan Müller is not likely to go any further than its
predecessors, but the discussion around it may lead to support for a

                    <span>Many commercial integration tools market their ability to own the
      integration landscape and call out to general purpose languages as needed.
      While I can appreciate the marketing behind such messaging — it promotes
      product penetration and lock-in — as architectural guidance, it is exactly
      backwards. Instead, we should almost always manage the interface evolution
      in a general purpose language for at least two reasons: so we can better
      manage the complexity of maintaining a clean interface, and so that we
      avoid the gravitational pull of our tool&#x27;s mental model when making
      strategic integration decisions.

                    <span>This is a pseudo-transcript (actual words modified to be more readable than a 100% faithful transcription) of a short lightning talk I did at Twitter a year or two ago, on pitfalls of how we use latency metrics (with the actual service names anonymized per a comms request). Since this presentation, significant progress has been made on this on the infra side, so the situation is much improved over what was presented, but I think this is still relevant since, from talking to folks at peer companies, many folks are facing similar issues.
We frequently use tail latency metrics here at Twitter. Most frequently, service owners want to get cluster-wide or Twitter-wide latency numbers for their services. Unfortunately, the numbers that service owners tend to use differ from what we&#x27;d like to meas…</span>

                    <span>Reference counts are a commonly used mechanism for tracking the life cycle
of objects in a computing system.  As long as every user of an object
correctly maintains its references by incrementing and decrementing the
reference count, that object will persist for as long as it
is needed
and will be properly destroyed once the last user is done.  The &quot;correctly&quot;
in that sentence is important, though; things do not work
as well in the presence of reference-counting errors.  Networking
developer Eric Dumazet is working on a
reference-count tracking system that could prove useful for finding
these errors in the networking subsystem and, someday, throughout the kernel.</span>

                    <span>In this post we&#x27;re going to walk through how to use GitHub Actions to create a continuous integration (CI) pipeline that automatically tests, vets and lints your Go code.
For solo projects I usually create a pre-commit Git hook to carry out these kinds of checks, but for team projects or open-source work — where you don&#x27;t have control over everyone&#x27;s development environment — using a CI workflow is a great way to flag up potential problems and help catch bugs before they make it into production or a versioned release.
And if you&#x27;re already using GitHub to host your repository, it&#x27;s nice and easy to use their built-in functionality to do this without any need for additional third-party tools or services.
To demonstrate how it works, let&#x27;s run through a step-by-step example.

                    <span>This article was discussed on Hacker News.
I recently learned of csvquote, a tool that encodes troublesome
CSV characters such that unix tools can correctly process them. It
reverses the encoding at the end of the pipeline, recovering the original
input. The original implementation handles CSV quotes using the
straightforward, naive method. However, there’s a better approach that is
not only simpler, but around 3x faster on modern hardware. Even more,
there’s yet another approach using SIMD intrinsics, plus some bit
twiddling tricks, which increases the processing speed by an order of
magnitude. My csvquote implementation includes both
approaches.
Background
Records in CSV data are separated by line feeds, and fields are separated
by commas. Fields may be quoted.

                    <span>The CentOS blog has announced the release of CentOS Stream 9:

CentOS Stream is a continuous-delivery distribution providing each point-release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). Before a package is formally introduced to CentOS Stream, it undergoes a battery of tests and checks—both automated and manual—to ensure it meets the stringent standards for inclusion in RHEL. Updates posted to Stream are identical to those posted to the unreleased minor version of RHEL. The aim? For CentOS Stream to be as fundamentally stable as RHEL itself.

To achieve this stability, each major release of Stream starts from a stable release of Fedora Linux—In CentOS Stream 9, this begins with Fedora 34, which is the same code base from which RHEL 9 is built. As updated packages pass testing and meet standards for stability, they are pushed into CentOS Stream as well as the nightly build of RHEL.</span>

                    <span>It is natural, when looking at the kernel development process, to focus on
patches that find their way to acceptance and become a part of future
kernels.  But there can be value in looking at work that doesn&#x27;t clear the
bar; in failing, these patches often reveal things about the kernel and the
community that creates it.  Such is the case with the proof-of-concept
namespacefs
patch series recently posted by Yordan Karadzhov.  One should not
expect to see namespacefs in a future kernel but, in failing, this work
showed a real use case and why it is hard to satisfy that use case in the
kernel.</span>

                    <span>Writing (correct) concurrent code that uses locking to avoid race
conditions is difficult enough.  When the objective is to use lockless algorithms, relying on memory
barriers instead of locks to eliminate locking overhead, the problem
becomes harder 
still.  Bugs are easy to create and hard to find in this type of code.
There may be some help on the way, though, in the form of this
patch set from Marco Elver that enhances the Kernel
Concurrency 
Sanitizer (KCSAN) with  the ability to detect some types of missing
memory barriers.</span>

                    <span>Over on the Project Zero blog, Tavis Ormandy has a lengthy postmortem on a vulnerability that he found in the Network Security Services (NSS) cryptography library.  The vulnerability is a bog-standard buffer overflow that has existed in the library since 2012 despite various kinds of static analysis, testing, and fuzzing that Mozilla and others have applied to it over the years.  He found it with a new fuzzing technique:

To solve this problem, I’ve been experimenting with monitoring the call stack during execution.

The naive implementation is too slow to be practical, but after a lot of optimization I had come up with a library that was fast enough to be integrated into coverage-guided fuzzing, and was testing how it performed with NSS and other libraries.

[...] The fuzzer I was using is able to isolate and extract interesting new ASN.1 OIDs, SEQUENCEs, INTEGERs, and so on. Once extracted, it can then randomly combine or insert them into template data. This isn’t really a new idea, but is a new implementation. I&#x27;m planning to open source this code in the future.</span>

struggle that the distribution has had before: whether using non-free Git
forges is appropriate.  One of the
differences this time, though, is that the focus is on where source-git (or src-git)
repositories will be hosted, which is a separate question from where the dist-git repository

third-party beneficiary rights under copyleft! In other words, Vizio’s

                    <span>Posted by Jessica Dene Earley-Cha, Developer Relations Engineer
 Like many other people who use their smartphone to make their lives easier, I’m way more likely to use an app that adapts to my behavior and is customized to fit me. Android apps already can support some personalization like the ability to long touch an app and a list of common user journeys are listed. When I long press my Audible app (an online audiobook and podcast service), it gives me a shortcut to the book I’m currently listening to; right now that is Daring Greatly by Brené Brown.  
Now, imagine if these shortcuts could also be triggered by a voice command –    and, when relevant to the user, show up in Google Assistant for easy use. 
 Wouldn&#x27;t that be lovely?

                    <span>While there are few rules on the names of variables, classes, functions,
and so on (i.e. identifiers) in the Python language, there are some
guidelines on how those things should be named.   But, of course, those
guidelines were not always followed in 
the standard library, especially in the early years of the project.  A
suggestion to add aliases to the standard library for
identifiers that do not follow the guidelines seems highly unlikely to go
anywhere, but it led to an interesting 
discussion on the python-ideas mailing list.</span>

      Building software is risky and expensive, and software product companies
      can spread that risk and expense across multiple customers. But my

      of tools that are available to buy for systems integration are not
      products that directly solve a business problem.

      these teams to be engaged in broader architectural decision making. In

                    <span>Posted by Alessandro Palmieri, Regional Lead for Spain Developer Communities
 Google Developer Groups (GDGs) around the world are in a unique position to organize events on technology topics that community members are passionate about.  That’s what happened in Spain in July 2021, where two GDG chapters decided to put on an event called AI Fest after noticing a lack of conferences dedicated exclusively to artificial intelligence. “Artificial intelligence is everywhere, although many people do not know it,” says Irene Ruiz Pozo, the organizer of GDG Murcia and GDG Cartagena. While AI has the potential to transform industries from retail to real estate with products like Dialogflow and Lending DocAI, “there are still companies falling behind,” she notes.

                    <span>One of the key features of the extended BPF virtual machine is the verifier
built into the kernel that ensures that all BPF programs are safe to run.
BPF developers often see the verifier as a bit of a mixed blessing, though;
while it can catch a lot of problems before they happen, it can also be
hard to please.  Comparisons with a well-meaning but rule-bound and picky
bureaucracy would not be entirely misplaced.  The bpf_loop()
proposal from Joanne Koong is an attempt to make pleasing the BPF
bureaucrats a bit easier for one type of loop construct.</span>

                    <span>Version
8.1.0 of the PHP language has been released.  This release includes a
number of new features, including enumerations,
read-only
properties,
fibers, and more.

Meanwhile, a
new foundation has been created to support development of PHP:


	The initial purpose of the PHP Foundation is to support the
	development of PHP by contracting developers to work on php-src
	either part-time or full-time. If that sounds interesting to you,
	be sure to apply!

	The foundation does not have any decision-making power on language
	changes: these remain within the sole purview of the internals
	mailing list and the RFC process. The fact that some work has been
	funded by the foundation does not imply that it will be accepted
	into PHP.

                    <span>In this short post we&#x27;re going to discuss how to add, modify or delete URL query string parameters in Go. To illustrate, we&#x27;ll look at how to change this URL:



To this:



If you want to change the URL query string in place:

  

Running this will print out:



If you want to create a clone of the URL but with a different query string, while leaving the original URL unchanged, you need to create a copy of the original url.URL struct first. 
There are a couple of ways to do this. You can either re-parse the URL, or you can dereference the original url.URL and make a copy, like so:



When you do this, you create a new newURL variable of type url.URL which is initialized to the (dereferenced) value of *originalURL. This means that newURL has a different address in memory to originalURL.
Putting this together, the pattern for creating a new URL with different parameters is:



Running this will print out:



As a side note, you can use this technique any time you want to &#x27;clone&#x27; a URL and make changes to it. For example to create a clone of a URL with a different path, you can do this:</span>

                    <span>In different programming languages, the behavior of virtual functions differs when it comes to constructors and destructors. Incorrect use of virtual functions is a classic mistake. Developers often use virtual functions incorrectly. In this article, we discuss this classic mistake. I suppose the reader is familiar with virtual functions in C++. Let&#x27;s get straight to the point. When we call a virtual function in a constructor, the function is overridden only within a base class or a currently created class. Constructors in the derived classes have not yet been called. Therefore, the virtual functions implemented in them will not be called. Let me illustrate this.</span>

                    <span>11월 23일 오전 제12대·13대 대통령을 지낸 전두환 씨가 사망했습니다. 전 씨는 12·12군사쿠데타를 일으켜 권력을 탈취한 뒤, 5.18민주화운동을 무자비하게 진압해 수많은 이들을 희생시켰으며 집권기간 내내 독재로 일관하며 시민들의 민주화 열망을 짓밟았습니다. 하지만 권력에서 물러나 죽음에 이르기까지 단 한 번도 과오를 사죄하지 않았습니다. 이처럼 역사 속에서 학살자이자 독재자로 평가받는 전 씨가 사망하자 언론은 관련 보도를 쏟아냈는데요. 민주언론시민연합은 […]</span>
