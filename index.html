                    <span>The Software Freedom Conservancy provides
an update on its suit against Vizio for
copyleft license violations.  Vizio&#x27;s response was not to release the
source code:

Instead, Vizio filed
a request to &quot;remove&quot; the case from California State Court (into US federal
court), which indicates Vizio&#x27;s belief that consumers have no
third-party beneficiary rights under copyleft! In other words, Vizio’s
answer to this complaint is not to comply with the copyleft licenses, but instead imply that Software Freedom Conservancy — and all other purchasers of the devices who might want to assert their right under GPL and LGPL to complete, corresponding source — have no right to even ask for that source code.</span>

 Like many other people who use their smartphone to make their lives easier, I’m way more likely to use an app that adapts to my behavior and is customized to fit me. Android apps already can support some personalization like the ability to long touch an app and a list of common user journeys are listed. When I long press my Audible app (an online audiobook and podcast service), it gives me a shortcut to the book I’m currently listening to; right now that is Daring Greatly by Brené Brown.  
Now, imagine if these shortcuts could also be triggered by a voice command –    and, when relevant to the user, show up in Google Assistant for easy use. 
 Wouldn&#x27;t that be lovely?

                    <span>While there are few rules on the names of variables, classes, functions,
and so on (i.e. identifiers) in the Python language, there are some
guidelines on how those things should be named.   But, of course, those
guidelines were not always followed in 
the standard library, especially in the early years of the project.  A
suggestion to add aliases to the standard library for
identifiers that do not follow the guidelines seems highly unlikely to go
anywhere, but it led to an interesting 
discussion on the python-ideas mailing list.</span>

                    <span>“Build versus buy” decisions are everywhere today, and rightly so.
      Building software is risky and expensive, and software product companies
      can spread that risk and expense across multiple customers. But my
      colleague Brandon Byars argues that the kinds
      of tools that are available to buy for systems integration are not
      products that directly solve a business problem.

      the need to scale architectural thinking to larger organizations while
      allowing teams to be as autonomous as possible. The approach he&#x27;s
      currently using is the &quot;Advice Process&quot;, that encourages and supports
      these teams to be engaged in broader architectural decision making. In
      this first installment, Andrew describes this advice process, later
      installments will dig into four supporting elements that help make it work.

 Google Developer Groups (GDGs) around the world are in a unique position to organize events on technology topics that community members are passionate about.  That’s what happened in Spain in July 2021, where two GDG chapters decided to put on an event called AI Fest after noticing a lack of conferences dedicated exclusively to artificial intelligence. “Artificial intelligence is everywhere, although many people do not know it,” says Irene Ruiz Pozo, the organizer of GDG Murcia and GDG Cartagena. While AI has the potential to transform industries from retail to real estate with products like Dialogflow and Lending DocAI, “there are still companies falling behind,” she notes.

                    <span>One of the key features of the extended BPF virtual machine is the verifier
built into the kernel that ensures that all BPF programs are safe to run.
BPF developers often see the verifier as a bit of a mixed blessing, though;
while it can catch a lot of problems before they happen, it can also be
hard to please.  Comparisons with a well-meaning but rule-bound and picky
bureaucracy would not be entirely misplaced.  The bpf_loop()
proposal from Joanne Koong is an attempt to make pleasing the BPF
bureaucrats a bit easier for one type of loop construct.</span>

                    <span>If the pandemic was the big story of 2020, then climate change was the big story of 2021, with prolonged freezes in Texas, raging wildfires in California, and devastating floods in Europe. Yet even as more and more people wake up to the reality of a hotter world, we’re apparently still not ready to pull […]

                    <span>For the last month I&#x27;ve been spending a lot of time working on Space War.  I know, I know, I should have been working on Clean Code Episode 67: Legacy Code, and Euler 5, and Countest and Curmugeon 3.  I should have been working on a blog, or a new book, or...  But I couldn&#x27;t let go of Space War.  It kept calling me.
The first time I wrote Space War was in 1978.  I wrote it in Alcom, which was a simple derivative of Focal, which was an analog of Basic for the PDP-8.  The computer was an M365 which was an augmented version of a PDP-8 and was proprietery to Teradyne, my employer at the time.
The UI was screen based, using character graphics, similar to curses.  Screen updates took on the order of a second.  All input was through the keyboard.

                    <span>Version
8.1.0 of the PHP language has been released.  This release includes a
number of new features, including enumerations,
read-only
properties,
fibers, and more.

Meanwhile, a
new foundation has been created to support development of PHP:


	The initial purpose of the PHP Foundation is to support the
	development of PHP by contracting developers to work on php-src
	either part-time or full-time. If that sounds interesting to you,
	be sure to apply!

	The foundation does not have any decision-making power on language
	changes: these remain within the sole purview of the internals
	mailing list and the RFC process. The fact that some work has been
	funded by the foundation does not imply that it will be accepted
	into PHP.

                    <span>In this short post we&#x27;re going to discuss how to add, modify or delete URL query string parameters in Go. To illustrate, we&#x27;ll look at how to change this URL:



To this:



If you want to change the URL query string in place:

  

Running this will print out:



If you want to create a clone of the URL but with a different query string, while leaving the original URL unchanged, you need to create a copy of the original url.URL struct first. 
There are a couple of ways to do this. You can either re-parse the URL, or you can dereference the original url.URL and make a copy, like so:



When you do this, you create a new newURL variable of type url.URL which is initialized to the (dereferenced) value of *originalURL. This means that newURL has a different address in memory to originalURL.
Putting this together, the pattern for creating a new URL with different parameters is:



Running this will print out:



As a side note, you can use this technique any time you want to &#x27;clone&#x27; a URL and make changes to it. For example to create a clone of a URL with a different path, you can do this:</span>

                    <span>As IoT networks become larger using conventional anomaly detection algorithms on large datasets can take hours or days, which increases vulnerability to IoT cyber-attacks. ShieldIoT’s coreset-AI helps cut that time down to minutes.

                    <span>In different programming languages, the behavior of virtual functions differs when it comes to constructors and destructors. Incorrect use of virtual functions is a classic mistake. Developers often use virtual functions incorrectly. In this article, we discuss this classic mistake. I suppose the reader is familiar with virtual functions in C++. Let&#x27;s get straight to the point. When we call a virtual function in a constructor, the function is overridden only within a base class or a currently created class. Constructors in the derived classes have not yet been called. Therefore, the virtual functions implemented in them will not be called. Let me illustrate this.</span>

    Interactive Canvas helps developers build multimodal apps for games, storytelling, and educational experiences on smart displays like the Nest Hub and Nest Hub Max. Setting up an Interactive Canvas app involves building a web app, a conversational model, and a server-based fulfillment to respond to voice commands. All three of these components need to be built out to test your apps using the simulator in the Actions Console. This works for teams who are able to build all three at once… but it means that everything has to be hooked up, even if you just want to test out the web portion of your app. In many cases, the web app provides the bulk of the functionality of an Interactive Canvas app. We recently published Interactive Canvas Dev…</span>

Perceiving that one is not like everyone else can be painful. Yet, the experience can also be illuminating. As a child in Brazil, João Victor Ipirajá, lead of the Google Student Developer Club (GDSC) at the Federal Institute of Science and Technology of Ceará (IFCE), knew he was different. He often felt overwhelmed by physical sensations and missed social cues. When he was eventually diagnosed as being on the autistic spectrum, he was actually relieved. Far from being a limitation, the realization gave him a new perspective on his intellectual strengths—such as his ability to perceive mathematical concepts in a highly visual way and his capacity for logical thinking and computer programming. “I was reborn…</span>

                    <span>New Standard, new ways to initialize objects!
With C++20, we get a handy way of initializing data members. The new feature is called designated initializers and might be familiar to C programmers.
Let’s have a look at this small feature:
The basics
Designated Initialization is a form of Aggregate Initialization.
As of C++20, an Aggregate type::
is an array type or,
is a class type that:

has no private or protected direct non-static data members
has no user-declared or inherited constructors
has no virtual, private, or protected base classes
has no virtual member functions
In a basic form in C++20, you can write:
Type obj &#x3D; { .designator &#x3D; val, .designator &#x3D; val2, ... };
// or
Type obj &#x3D; { .designator { val }, .designator { val2 }, ... };


For example:

    double x { 0.0 }…</span>

                    <span>It&#x27;s cool when enthusiastic developers create a working clone of a famous game. It&#x27;s even cooler when people are ready to continue the development of such projects! In this article, we check TheXTech with PVS-Studio. TheXTech is an open implementation of the game from the Super Mario universe. TheXTech is the SMBX 1.3. game engine rewritten on C++. The original SMBX (Super Mario Bros. X) was written on Visual Basic 6 by Andrew Spinks in 2009. It allows to create levels from the elements of the Nintendo&#x27;s Super Mario Bros games. TheXTech accurately reproduces the original game&#x27;s behavior. It also includes optional bug fixes. It runs not only on Windows, but also on macOS, and Linux systems with x86, ARM or PowerPC processors. Some developers also ported it on 3DS and PS Vista The TheXTech developer — Vitaliy Novichkov (Wohlstand) — described the development process in detail on Habr. He also described the techniques he used to smooth out the differences when porting the project from VB6 to C++. There&#x27;s a disclaimer on the GitHub page that explains why the source code is not in the best condition. It&#x27;s because the original code is unstructured something fierce. Its fragments you&#x27;ll see below.</span>

                    <span>One does not normally expect a lot of disagreement over a 13-line patch
that effectively tweaks a single line of code.  Occasionally, though, such
a patch can expose a disagreement over how the behavior of the kernel
should be managed.  This patch
from Drew DeVault, who is evidently taking a break from stirring up
the npm community, is a case in point.  It brings to light the question
of how  the kernel community should pick default values for configurable
parameters like resource limits.</span>

                    <span>One of the mechanisms of static analysis is method annotations of popular libraries. Annotations provide more information about functions during errors detecting. CARLA is an impressive open-source project in C++ that helped us implement this mechanism to our analyzer. Subsequently, the simulator became a test-target for the improved PVS-Studio static analyzer. CARLA is an open-source simulator for autonomous driving research. CARLA has been developed from the ground up to support development, training, and validation of autonomous driving systems. In addition to open-source code and protocols, CARLA provides open digital assets (urban layouts, buildings, vehicles) that were created for this purpose and can be used freely. The simulation platform supports flexible specification of sensor suites and environmental conditions. The project is cross-platform and contains almost 78,000 lines of C++ code. In the project repository, we also found code written in Python, XML, YAML, DOS Batch, CMake and other languages.</span>

relicensing update presentation at the 2021 LLVM Developer’s meeting.
The very short summary is that we are currently in the long tail phase of
collecting relicensing agreements of past contributors. We already at the time
of this writing have more than 94% of older code relicensed. We hope to crowd
source getting through the long tail to get as close to 100% as possible.
Call for help
You can help by looking through the list of remaining individuals and
corporations we need to get agreements
from,

warnings when something goes wrong.  It does not, however, provide a lot of
guidance regarding what should happen when a warning is issued.  Alexander
Popov recently posted a
patch series adding an option for the system&#x27;s response to warnings;
that series seems unlikely to be applied in anything close to its current
form, but it did succeed in provoking a discussion on how warnings should

 Google’s Business Messages let customers message a business directly from Google Search, Google Maps, and any brand-managed property. Developers of Business Messages can leverage tools like Dialogflow to create AI-powered conversational experiences, where customers can chat with lifelike virtual agents that understand, interact, and talk in natural ways. Meanwhile the business can leverage real life agents when needed. 
In this article, I’ll give a brief overview of Business Messages, how to get started developing with the platform, and then walkthrough how to set up an AI-powered conversion using the Bot-in-a-Box feature.  
Let’s get started!

                    <span>Even encrypted data sent on the internet leaves some footprints—metadata
about where packets originate, where they are bound, and when they are sent. 
Mix networks are
meant to hide that metadata by routing packets through various intermediate
nodes to try to thwart the traffic analysis used by nation-state-level
adversaries to identify &quot;opponents&quot; of various kinds. Tor is perhaps the
best-known mix network, but there are others that make different
tradeoffs to increase the security of their users.  Rollercoaster
is a recently announced mechanism that extends the functionality of mix
networks in order to more efficiently communicate among groups.</span>

Currently, the organization gathered many libraries under its wing. We have already tested some of these libraries with the help of PVS-Studio. The next project to check with the analyzer - LINQ to DB.  LINQ to DB is a database access framework based on LINQ. LINQ to DB has collected the best of its predecessors. It allows you to work with various DBMS, whereas LINQ to SQL back in the day allowed you to work only with MS SQL. It&#x27;s not as heavy and complicated as LINQ to SQL or Entity Framework. LINQ to DB provides more control and quick access to data. The framework is not that big: it&#x27;s written in C# and contains more than 40,000 lines of code. LINQ to DB is also one of the .NET Foundation projects. We have previously checked the projects of this organization: Windows Forms, Xamarin.Forms, Teleric UI for UWP, etc.</span>

Since then, integrating Google Pay products has become easier and faster, with features like a common business profile and a unified dashboard.  
Today, we are adding Passes as a new section to Google Pay’s Business Console, so you can manage all your Google Pay resources from one place. You can find the new Passes section in the console’s left-hand navigation bar, and from there, access your tickets, loyalty programs, offers and other passes resources.

rippling through various development
communities since their disclosure on 
November 1.  The oddities that can arise when handling Unicode, and
bidirectional Unicode in particular, in a programming 
language have led Rust, for
example, to check for
the problematic code points in strings and comments and, by default,
refuse to compile if they are present.  Python has chosen a different path,
but work is underway to help inform programmers of the kinds of pitfalls that
Trojan Source has highlighted.</span>

https://github.com/google/syzkaller/
syzkaller 는 QEMU 기반으로 운영체제를 부팅한 후 Host 와 Guest 사이에 ssh 연결을 수립하고 system call fuzzing 을 수행하는 도구다. 일반적으로 syzkaller 는 x86 리눅스 위에서 테스트 대상 x86 리눅스를 QEMU로 테스트하는 방식으로 많이 사용된다. 그러나 이 글에서는 Aarch64 리눅스를 테스트하고자 한다.
전체적인 과정은 공식 메뉴얼을 따랐지만, 설명이 친절한 편이 아니어서 직접 삽질을 하면서 다시 정리해보았다.


1. Kernel Build (with KASAN)
테스트 하고자 하는 리눅스 커널을 빌드한다. 앞선 글에서 설명했으나, 그때는 별다른 보안 옵션을 설정하지 않았다. 지금은 KASAN, KCOV 등의 새니타이징 기능을 켜고 퍼즈 테스트 성능을 측정할 수 있도록 하는 부분이 다르다. 
일단 x86에서 진행하는 것이라면 크로스 컴파일을 통해 Aarch64 리눅스 커널을 빌드할 필요성이 있다. 크로스 컴파일을 위한 툴 체인을 받아야 한다.

Individuals matter.
A pattern I&#x27;ve repeatedly seen during the roadmap creation and review process is that people will plan out the next few quarters of work and then assign some number of people to it, one person for one quarter to a project, two people for three quarters to another, etc. Nominally, this process enables teams to understand what other teams are doing and plan appropriately.

     Merchant Center lets merchants manage how their in-store and online product     inventory appears on Google. It allows them to reach hundreds of millions     of people looking to buy products like yours each day. 

    To upload their products, merchants can make use of feeds, that is, files     with a list of products in a specific format. These can be shared with     Merchant Center in different ways: using Google Sheets, SFTP or FTP shares,     Google Cloud Storage or manually through the user interface. These methods     work great for the majority of cases. But, if a merchant&#x27;s product list     grows over time, they might reach the usage limits of the feeds.

                    <span>Get it here: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-399/

Python 3.9.9 is the eighth maintenance release of the legacy 3.9 series. Python 3.10 is now the latest feature release series of Python 3. Get the latest release of 3.10.x here.

3.9.9 was released out of schedule as a hotfix for an argparse regression in Python 3.9.8 which caused complex command-line tools to fail recognizing sub-commands properly. Details in BPO-45235. There are only three other bugfixes in this release compared to 3.9.8. See the changelog for details on what changed.

Upgrading to 3.9.9 is highly recommended if you’re running Python 3.9.8.

The next Python 3.9 maintenance release will be 3.9.10, currently scheduled for 2022-01-03.

We apologize for the inconvenience

…and still hope you’ll enjoy the new release!

                    <span>Version 2.34.0 of the Git source-code management system is out.
&quot;It is comprised of 834 non-merge commits since
v2.33.0, contributed by 109 people, 29 of which are new faces&quot;.  See
this
GitHub blog post for a look at some of the more significant changes in
this release:


	ort does just that: it’s a full-blown rewrite of the merge strategy
	that aims to emulate the same concepts behind recursive while
	avoiding many of its long-standing performance and correctness
	problems. In a merge containing many renames, ort outperforms
	recursive by 500x. For a series of similar merges (like in a rebase
	operation), the speedup is over 9000x since ort can cache and reuse
	results from previous merges.</span>

                    <span>Linus Torvalds released
5.16-rc1 and ended the 5.16 merge window on November 14, as
expected.  At that point, 12,321 non-merge changesets had been pulled into
the mainline; about 5,500 since our summary of
the first half of the merge window was written.  As is usually the case,
the patch mix in the latter part of the merge window tended more toward
fixes, but there were a number other changes as well.</span>

                    <span>Would you like to gain 20…35 or even 50% speed improvements when searching in associative containers? In this blog post, we’ll explore a technique called “heterogenous access” that offers such impressive speedups. We’ll explore ordered containers, and the support for unordered collections added recently in C++20.
Recap on heterogeneous lookup in ordered containers
Let’s bring the example and have a look at how this feature works for ordered containers.
If you have the following code:
std::map intMap { 
    { &quot;Hello Super Long String&quot;, 1 }, 
    { &quot;Another Longish String&quot;, 2 }, 
    { &quot;This cannot fall into SSO buffer&quot;, 3 }
};

std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Lookup in intMap with by const char*:\n&quot;;
std::cout &lt;&lt; intMap.contains(&quot;Hello Super Long String&quot;) &lt;&lt; &#x27;\n&#x27;;

Recently we heard the news that the emulator learned how run all the games from the console&#x27;s catalog. That&#x27;s a good excuse to analyze the project. We&#x27;ll see which errors remained after new fixes were added to the project. The project is quite hefty. It contains about 300 thousand lines of C++ code and relies upon many external dependencies that include the following: For the GUI part, the project uses Qt - however, that is taken from the system library.

                    <span>Last week on the IoT Podcast, we discussed the news of Facebook ceasing the use of facial recognition across the photos its users upload. From our perspective, this was a big win for the Facebook user community. Why? Users had no control over whether Facebook would scan photos uploaded by others and then tag all […]

                    <span>미루고 미루던 리눅스 커널 취약점 연구를 올해가 가기 전에 최소한 &#x27;시작&#x27;은 해보려고 한다. 
아직 초보인데, Defenit팀의 김현우(V4bel)님께서 인프런에서 진행하시는 강좌가 정말 큰 도움이 되었다.
https://www.inflearn.com/course/%EB%A6%AC%EB%88%85%EC%8A%A4-%EC%BB%A4%EB%84%90-%ED%95%B4%ED%82%B9/
해당 강좌는 Intel x86_64 환경을 기준으로 되어있는데, 이를 Aarch64 리눅스로 하여 열심히 삽질 중이다. 변환했을 때 똑같이 적용되는 것도 있고, 안 되는 것도 많다..


우선 Aarch64 환경에서 커널 빌드 및 디버깅을 하기 위한 절차를 기록해둔다. 대부분의 내용은 위에서 언급한 강좌에서 김현우님께서 가이드해주신 방법을 참고했으며, Aarch64 로 변환할 때 필요한 수정사항들을 내가 작성했다(이 게시물은 강사님의 허락을 받고 기록해두는 것이다.)
 
(참고로 1~3번 과정을 생략하고, 내가 올려둔 파일을 다운로드 하셔도 됨)
1. 리눅스 커널 빌드
우선 리눅스 커널을 직접 빌드할 수 있는 환경이 마련되어야 한다. 강의에서는 인텔 리눅스 상에서 인텔 리눅스를 빌드하는 방식으로 진행되었다. 그러나 Aarch64 아키텍처용 리눅스를 빌드하려면 방법이 달라진다. 대략 두가지 방법이 있다.
1) Intel 리눅스상에서 cross-compiler 를 사용해서 Aarch64 리눅스 이미지를 빌드하는 방법.
2) Aarch64 리눅스 상에서 Aarch64 리눅스를 빌드하는 방법.
그동안은 대부분 1의 방법이 선호되었다. 왜냐…</span>

                    <span>Over on the Google Security blog, Jonathan Metzman announced the release of ClusterFuzzLite, which is &quot;a continuous fuzzing solution that runs as part of CI/CD workflows to find vulnerabilities faster than ever before&quot;.   ClusterFuzzLite is a descendant of OSS-Fuzz, which we looked at in 2017.

Large projects including systemd and curl are already using ClusterFuzzLite during code review, with positive results. According to Daniel Stenberg, author of curl, “When the human reviewers nod and have approved the code and your static code analyzers and linters can&#x27;t detect any more issues, fuzzing is what takes you to the next level of code maturity and robustness. OSS-Fuzz and ClusterFuzzLite help us maintain curl as a quality project, around the clock, every day and every commit.”

[...] To learn more, check out the ClusterFuzzLite documentation. ClusterFuzzLite currently supports GitHub Actions, Google Cloud Build and Prow. We built this with CI system extensibility in mind, and adding support for other CI systems is straightforward. Please contact us if you’re interested in contributing support, or have any questions, feedback or feature requests.</span>

the kernel, with an ongoing reliance on various heuristics for

                    <span>2007년 국회에 차별금지법이 처음 발의됐습니다. 노무현 정부 시절 정부 입법으로 처음 발의된 차별금지법은 14년간 발의와 폐기를 반복하며 아직도 국회 문턱을 넘지 못하고 있습니다. 제21대 국회에서는 장혜영 정의당 의원과 권인숙·박주민·이상민 더불어민주당 의원 등이 대표발의한 4건의 차별금지법안이 발의돼 있습니다. 지난 6월 10만 명 동의로 달성된 ‘차별금지법 제정에 관한 국민동의 청원’이 국회 법제사법위원회 심사를 기다리고 있습니다. 국민동의 청원 […]</span>

                    <span>While the &quot;Trojan Source&quot; vulnerabilities
have, thus far, generated far more publicity than examples of actual
exploits, addressing the problem still seems like a good thing to do.
There are several places where defenses could be put into place; text
editors, being the place where developers look at a lot of code, are one
obvious example.  The discussion of how to enhance Emacs in this regard has
made it clear, though, that there are multiple opinions about how an editor
should flag potential attacks.</span>

                    <span>On November 10, the Go programming language community celebrated the 12th anniversary of its release as open-source software.  The post covers a number of different topics, including the consolidation of web sites at go.dev, releases and their features over the last year, as well as a look to the future:

In February, the Go 1.18 release will expand the new register-based calling convention to non-x86 architectures, bringing dramatic performance improvements with it. It will include the new Go fuzzing support. And it will be the first release to include support for generics.

Generics will be one of our focuses for 2022. The initial release in Go 1.18 is only the beginning. We need to spend time using generics and learning what works and what doesn’t, so that we can write best practices and decide what should be added to the standard library and other libraries. We expect that Go 1.19 (expected in August 2022) and later releases will further refine the design and implementation of generics as well as integrating them further into the overall Go experience.</span>

(1) 시간은 무한성과 자족성을 존재자에게 보장해 줄 수 없는 관계이다. (2) 시간은 사회성을 뜻하는 관계이다. (3) 시간은 존재자의 존재라는 존재의 지평이 아니라, 존재 저편의 방식으로, 즉 타자에 대한 사유 관계이다. (4) 시간은 타인의 얼굴.......</span>

                    <span>Python supports default values for arguments to functions, but those
defaults are evaluated at function-definition time.  A proposal to add
defaults that are evaluated when the function is called has been discussed
at some length on the python-ideas mailing list.  The idea came about, in part,
due to yet another resurrection of the proposal
for None-aware operators in Python.  Late-bound defaults would help
with one use case for those operators, but there are other, stronger
reasons to consider their addition to the language.</span>

                    <span>Good technical design decisions are very dependent on context. Teams that
    regularly work together on common goals are able to communicate regularly
    and negotiate changes quickly. These teams exhibit a strong force of
    alignment, and can make technology and design decisions that harness that
    strong force. As we zoom out in a larger organisation an increasingly
    weak force exists between teams and divisions that work independently
    and have less frequent collaboration. Recognising the differences in these
    strong and weak forces allows us to make better decisions and give better
    guidance for each level, allowing for more empowered teams that can move
    faster.

                    <span>Within each normal-sized team, limit the choice of alternatives for any class
	of technology to three. These are: the current sensible default, the one we&#x27;re
	experimenting with as a trial, and the one that we hate and want to retire.
The conversation goes like this: We want to introduce a new messaging
  technology. How many do we have already in place? Oh we have three in active
  use, including one that&#x27;s considered legacy and we&#x27;re partway through
  migrating off and one that we experimented with previously but didn&#x27;t gain
  traction. Ok, so we&#x27;re at our limit now. If we want to add another messaging
  tech then we have two choices. Either migrate all of our apps off the legacy
  tech, or properly rid ourselves of the failed experiment. This is quite
  closely related to the idea of capping the number of Innovation Tokens in
  use within your teams.
At a team level these kinds of limits are relatively easy
  to maintain and discuss and act upon, because we have common priorities and
  ways of working and high trust, high bandwidth communication. At the scope of
  the whole organisation the challenge is similar, but getting alignment takes a
  lot longer and doing actual migration and consolidation work can take a long
  time - so we sometimes have to allow for more variation in technology. We also use 
  different techniques to discuss and communicate the status of our preferred technologies.
An approach we use at MYOB to engage our whole organisation in broader decisions about
  technology is by publishing our own MYOB Technology Radar, following the
  format of the Thoughtworks Technology Radar.
  This approach of building our own radar
  involves taking input from all of our verticals and teams, and making a clear
  statement on what technologies we encourage teams to adopt, trial, or more
  importantly which ones to keep clear of.</span>

Nowadays, you can find various static analyzers: from free open-source to cross-functional commercial solutions. On the one hand, it&#x27;s great – you can choose from many options. On the other hand – you have to perform advanced research to find the right tool for your team. Before we talk about selection criteria, let&#x27;s briefly discuss the methodology. Static analysis is an automated method to find errors in source code by means of specialized programs. The purpose of such analysis is to identify unsafe and problem parts of the project that can lead to more serious consequences – vulnerabilities. Keep in mind that users are not QA engineers. Bugs must not get into the release. That is why it&#x27;s better to use a static analyzer regularly. Run the analyzer once – get lots of messages. Believe us, you don&#x27;t want to sort them out. Moreover, to find and fix some errors you have to use more expensive methods at the following project stages.</span>

                    <span>The Julia programming language has
its roots in high-performance scientific computing, so it is no surprise
that it has facilities for concurrent processing. Those features are not
well-known outside of the Julia community, though, so it is interesting to
see the different types of parallel and concurrent computation that the
language supports. In addition, the upcoming release of Julia
version 1.7 brings an improvement to the language&#x27;s
concurrent-computation palette,

                    <span>* 전제와 결론을 가진 논증으로 요약해 보라. 신탁은 내가 가장 현명하다고 이야기했습니다. 이 이야기를 들었을 때, 나는 신의 말은 무엇을 뜻하는가? 신의 수수께끼를 어떻게 해석할 것인가? 하고 자문해 보았습니다. 왜냐하면 나는 크든 작든 간에 지혜가 없다는 것을 알고 있기 때문입니다. 신이 내가 가장 현명한 사람이라고 말할 때 그는 무슨 말을 하려고 한 것일까? 그는 신이고, 따라서 거짓말을 할 수는 없는 일입니다. 거짓말을 한다는 것은 신에게는 어울리지 않는 일입니다. 오랫동안 숙고한 끝에 이 문제를 푸는 방법을 생각해 냈습니다. 만일 나 자신보다 더 현명한 사람을 찾아내기만 한다면 나는 신탁의 소리를 반박할 수 있을.......</span>

                    <span>Three major tools that companies have to influence behavior are incentives, process, and culture. People often mean different things when talking about these, so I&#x27;ll provide an example of each so we&#x27;re on the same page (if you think that I should be using a different word for the concept, feel free to mentally substitute that word).
Getting people to show up to meetings on time
Incentive: dock pay for people who are late
Process: don&#x27;t allow anyone who&#x27;s late into the meeting
Culture: people feel strongly about showing up on time



Getting people to build complex systems
Incentive: require complexity in promo criteria
Process: make process for creating or executing on a work item so heavyweight that people stop doing simple work
Culture: people enjoy building complex systems and/or build…</span>

                    <span>The LXD team has announced
the release of version 4.20 of the LXD system container and virtual
machine manager.

This is one very busy release with a lot of new features.

VM users will be happy to see the initial implementation of live migration and core scheduling support. Container users are getting new configuration keys to set sysctls.

Then the bulk of the new features are all network related with peer network relationships, network zones for auto-generated DNS and SR-IOV accelerated OVN networks.

And lastly, on the clustering front, it’s now possible to better control what servers will be receiving new workloads.</span>

                    <span>The x86 instruction set is large, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it can&#x27;t get bigger
yet.  Upcoming Intel processors will feature a new set of instructions
under the name of &quot;Advanced Matrix Extensions&quot; (AMX) that can be used to
operate on matrix data.  After a somewhat bumpy development
process, support for AMX has found its way into the upcoming 5.16 kernel.
Using it will, naturally, require some changes by application developers.</span>

This article is the second in the series about refactoring with unique_ptr. You can read the first part here:
6 Ways to Refactor new/delete into unique ptr - C++ Stories
Basic assumptions
The code presented here will usually contain explicit new and delete, and we’d like to reduce their use and wrap resources (pointers) into RAII.
We’ll try to follow the rule: R.11: Avoid calling new and delete explicitly from the Core C++ Guidelines:
The pointer returned by new should belong to a resource handle (that can call delete). If the pointer returned b…</span>

 Python 3.9.8 and Python 3.11.0a2 with a fixed Tcl/Tk version. In 3.9.8 
it’s a patched 8.6.11 release while 3.11.0a2 is rocking the 
bleeding-edge 8.6.12rc1.

Since the issue also affected our latest stable version, 3.10.0, an

	Even though it started out as merely a list archival service, it
	quickly became obvious that lore could be used for a lot more. Many
	developers ended up using its search features to quickly locate
	emails of interest, which in turn raised a simple question — what
	if there was a way to “save a search” and have it deliver all new

optimization work has continued since then, and those 3.5 million IOPS
would be a deeply disappointing result now.  A recent disagreement over the

optimized block layer, though; when is a feature deemed important enough to

                    <span>Over at the SAMBA+ blog, the performance of the new ksmbd kernel SMB server and Samba in user space are compared:

ksmbd claims performance improvements on a wide range of benchmarks: the graphs on this page show a doubling of performance on some tests. There was also the notion that an in-kernel server is likely an easier place to support SMB Direct, which uses RDMA to transfer data between systems.

Clearly, those number are impressive, but at the same time recent improvements in Samba&#x27;s IO performance put this into perspective: by leveraging the new &quot;io_uring&quot; Linux API Samba is able to provide roughly 10x the throughput compared to ksmbd.

Time will tell whether it&#x27;s better to reside in kernel-space like ksmbd or in user-space like Samba in order to squeeze the last bit of performance out of the available hardware.


There are two graphs that show some impressive results for Samba.</span>

the process of starting a program on Linux in great detail.



	Well, __libc_start_main calls __libc_init_first,
	who immediately uses secret inside information to find the
	environment variables just after the terminating null of the
	argument vector and then sets a global variable __environ
	which __libc_start_main uses thereafter whenever it needs

	is established, then __libc_start_main uses the same trick
	and surprise! Just past the terminating null at the end of the
	envp array, there&#x27;s another vector, the ELF auxiliary
	vector the loader uses to pass some information to the process. An

                    <span>As of this writing, Linus Torvalds has pulled exactly 6,800 non-merge
changesets into the mainline repository for the 5.16 kernel release.  That
is probably a little over half of what will arrive during this merge
window, so this is a good time to catch up on what has been pulled so far.
There are many significant changes and some large-scale restructuring of
internal kernel code, but relatively few ground-breaking new
features.</span>

The emulator, according to its website, has a version for Windows, Linux, and for Android smartphones. And recently it was launched on Xbox Series X and S. The project itself contains slightly less than a million lines of C and C++ code. DuckStation doesn&#x27;t release updates. Its developers regularly commit changes.

provided a binary that is misbehaving—crashing for instance—on Fedora and
other Linux distributions, there are situations where it may be harder to
do so.  A feature recently proposed for Fedora 36—currently
scheduled for the end of April 2022—would embed information into the
binaries themselves to show where they came from.  It is part of a
multi-distribution effort to standardize how this information is stored in
the binaries (and the libraries they use) to assist crash-reporting and other tools.</span>
