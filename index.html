depriving your editor of a couple of 24-hour, economy-class, middle-seat
experiences.  This naturally leads to a set of mixed feelings.  LCA has
always put a priority on interesting keynote talks, and that has carried
over into the online event; the opening keynote for LCA 2022 was given by
Brian Kernighan.  Despite being seen as a founder of our community,
Kernighan is rarely seen at Linux events; he used his LCA keynote to
reminisce for a while on where Unix came from and what its legacy is.</span>

	For this long-overdue release, a major effort underwent to remove
	the old encode/decode APIs and replace them with an N:M-based API,
	the entire libavresample library was removed, libswscale has a new,
	easier to use AVframe-based API, the Vulkan code was much improved,
	many new filters were added, including libplacebo integration, and
	finally, DoVi support was added, including tonemapping and
	remuxing. The default AAC encoder settings were also changed to
	improve quality.</span>

 the three new versions of Python released today do not contain Windows 
installers yet. This is temporary, due to a more complex than expected 
code signing certificate renewal.

We’ve held the releases all week while the situation is getting 
resolved but the urgency of 3.10.2 in particular made us release without
 the Windows installers after all. We apologize for the inconvenience 
and are doing everything we can to put the Windows installer in place as
 soon as possible.

We’re rooting for both Ee Durbin and Steve Dower who are helping us 
resolve this. Thanks for your hard work! Hopefully, by this time next 
week, this will only be a footnote in release management history.

                    <span>The ongoing memory folio work has caused
ripples through much of the kernel and inspired a few side projects, one of
which was the removal of slab-specific
fields from struct page.  That work has been pulled into the
mainline for the 5.17 kernel release; it is thus a good time to catch up
with the status of struct slab and why this work is important.</span>

interview with four Inkscape developers.


	From what I understand, what helped was finally porting the user
	interface from GTK2 to GTK3. It was just a huge task and brought
	many regressions, some of them are still in even after 2
	years. Just to compare, 1.0 was in alpha state for 1.5 years; but
	for 1.1, it was just 3 months. So if you want a faster release,
	don’t port your app. Too late for us though! And we probably need
	to port again to GTK4 now if we want to fix performance
	regressions.</span>

The Trice technique tries to fill this gap. It is the result of a long-year dissatisfaction and several attempts to find a loophole to make embedded programming more fun and effective.

                    <span>The deadlines
for various kinds of Fedora 36 change proposals have mostly passed at
this point, which led to something of a flurry of postings to the
distribution&#x27;s devel mailing list over the last month.  One of those, for a seemingly fairly
innocuous relocation of the RPM database from /var to
/usr, came in right at the buzzer for system-wide changes on
December 29.  There were, of course, other things going on around that
time, holidays, vacations, and so forth, so the discussion was relatively
muted until recently.  Proponents have a number of reasons why they would like
to see the move, but there is resistance, as well, that is due, at least in part, to the
longstanding &quot;tradition&quot; of the location for the database.</span>

                    <span>David Malcolm describes
some GCC improvements to defend against bidirectional-text attacks in
source code.


	My colleague Marek Polacek and I implemented a new warning for GCC
	12, -Wbidi-chars, for detecting Trojan Source attacks involving
	Unicode control characters. Marek implemented the guts of the
	warning, but when I tried it out on the examples provided by the
	Trojan Source researchers, I found I had trouble understanding the
	initial results—precisely because of the obfuscation itself.
	
	So for GCC 12, I&#x27;ve added a new flag to GCC diagnostics, indicating
	that the diagnostic itself relates to source code encoding. When
	any such diagnostic is printed, GCC will now escape non-ASCII
	characters in the source code.</span>

Have you ever thought about building an application or tool that solves a problem your community faces? Or perhaps you’ve felt inspired to build something that can help improve the lives of those you care about. The year ahead brings more opportunities for helping each other and giving back to our communities.  
With that in mind, we invite students around the world to join the Google Developer Student Clubs 2022 Solution Challenge! Where students from around the world are invited to solve for one of the United Nations&#x27; Sustainable Development Goals using Google technologies.

software throughout their, normally five-year-plus, support windows.  But
many of the projects those distributions are based on have far shorter
support periods; part of what the enterprise distributions sell is patching
over those mismatches.  But openSUSE Leap is not exactly an
enterprise distribution, so some users are chafing under the restrictions
that come from Leap being based on SUSE Enterprise Linux (SLE).  In
particular, shipping Python 3.6, which reached its end of life at the
end of 2021, is seen as problematic for the upcoming Leap 15.4 release.</span>

                    <span>One of the core challenges in a distributed system is keeping the state
      synchronized across all the nodes, especially when neither the nodes, or
      the connections between them, are reliable. The core approach to handle
      with is a replicated log: using the write-ahead log pattern
      over the cluster. Unmesh Joshi shows how this works using
      its most common implementation: the Raft protocol.

Ads Review Tool
   
This tool flags (and optionally deletes) policy violating ads across your accounts. Advertisers can learn from the output to ensure their ads are compliant with Google Ads Policies at all times. 
Business Challenge:
Advertisers operating at scale need a solution to holistically review policy violating ads across their accounts so they can ensure compliance with Google’s Ad Policies. As Google introduces more policies and enforcement mechanisms, advertisers need to continue checking their accounts to ensure they comply with Google’s Ads Policies.
Solution Overview:  
“Disapproved Ads Auditor” is a tool  that enables advertisers to review at scale all disapproved ads across their  Google Ads accounts. This view  allows advertisers to proactively audit their accounts , analyze the ad disapprovals holistically and identify  learnings to minimize and  reduce submission of potentially policy violating ads. 
The tool is based on a Python script, which can be run in either of the following modes: 
 
“Audit Mode”- export an output of disapproved ads across your accounts 
“Remove Mode” - delete currently disapproved ads and log details.
 
There are a few output files (see here) which are saved locally under the “output” folder and there is an optional feature to export on BigQuery for further data analysis (“Disapproved Ads Auditor” dataset). 
Skills Required:   
 
 Python 3.9+ 
 BigQuery API 
 Google Ads API 
 OAuth 2.0
 
Google Products Used:
 
Google Ads

on January 9, as expected.  This development cycle incorporated 14,190
changesets from 1,988 developers; it was thus quite a bit busier than its

	The other reason is that, with a project like GIMP, it’s hard to do
	just one thing. The team is constantly bombarded with requests that
	are mostly doable once you have a team of 10 to 20 full-time
	developers, which is light years away from where GIMP is now. Which
	results in a lot of running around between under-the-hood work, UX
	fixes, featurettes, better file formats support etc. So you give
	everyone a little of what they want but you end up delaying an
	actual release because the big stuff still needs to happen.</span>

on the latest NPM mess: the developer of the &quot;faker&quot; module deleted the
code and it&#x27;s development history from GitHub (with a force push), replaced
it with a malicious alternative, and broke dependencies for numerous
applications. 


	The reason behind this mischief on the developer&#x27;s part appears to
	be retaliation—against mega-corporations and commercial consumers
	of open-source projects who extensively rely on cost-free and
	community-powered software but do not, according to the developer,
	give back to the community.


GitHub has evidently called this action a violation of its terms of
service and disabled the owner&#x27;s account; NPM has restored a previous
version of the code.</span>

But, as you know, that’s not all.
Depending on how we count, C++20 brought around 80 Library features and 70 language changes, so there’s a lot to cover :)
In this article, I’ll show you 20 smaller C++20 things that are very handy and good to know. Ten language elements, and ten more for the Standard Library. Most of them with a cool example.

Now, almost 18 years later, the project has grown tremendously and those infrastructure choices are not necessarily the right choices today. According to a recent article, the LLVM community experienced record growth in 2021 with 1400 contributors to the LLVM Project. This is incredible growth! While there is a very real cost to change, it is clear that we need to invest in modernizing these tools to support the current and further growth of LLVM.

                    <span>Linux supports processor architectures where CPUs in the same system
might have 
different processing capacities; for example, the Arm big.LITTLE
systems combine fast, power-hungry CPUs with slower, more efficient
ones. Linux has also run for years on simultaneous
multithreading (SMT) architectures, where one CPU executes multiple
independent execution threads and is seen as if it were multiple cores.
There are architectures that mix both approaches. A recent discussion
on a patch
set submitted by Ricardo Neri shows that, on these systems, the
scheduler might distribute tasks in an inefficient way.</span>

                    <span>The OpenSSH suite of tools for
secure remote logins is used widely within our communities; it also
underlies things like remote Git repository access.
A recent experimental feature for the upcoming OpenSSH 8.9 release
will help close a security hole 
that can be exploited by attacker-controlled SSH servers (e.g. sshd) when the user is forwarding
authentication to a local ssh-agent.  Instead
of allowing the keys held in the agent to be used for authenticating to any
host where they might work, SSH agent 
restriction will allow users to specify where and how those keys can be
used.</span>

      more of his Patterns of Distributed Systems. With this one he attempts the
      tricky task of explaining Paxos. This is a well-known
      protocol developed by Leslie Lamport, for nodes to reach a reliable
      consensus when both they, and the network, are prone to unexpected
      failure. Although it&#x27;s well-known, it&#x27;s also notoriously difficult to
      understand, indeed we had considerable difficulty getting our heads around
      it. We hope this description makes it a bit easier for those who follow
      us.

over the last year or so.  In general, they have been met with skepticism,
particularly with regard to how well the features mesh with Fedora&#x27;s
goals, but also in how they will change the process of building RPM
packages.  A new proposal that would allow systems to (optionally) perform remote
attestation is likewise encountering headwinds; there are several
different concerns being raised in the discussion of it.</span>

editor to make a (bigger) fool of himself by posting a set of
predictions for what may come in the new year.  One should never pass up an
opportunity for a humbling experience, after all.  There can be no doubt
that interesting things will happen this year; let&#x27;s see how many random

mostly focused on the new associated &quot;GnuPG VS-Desktop&quot; business that is,
it seems, going quite well:


  For many years our work was mainly financed by donations and smaller
  projects.  Now we have reached a point where we can benefit from a
  continuous revenue stream to maintain and extend the software without
  asking for donations or grants.  This is quite a new experience to us
  and I am actually a bit proud to lead one of the few self-sustaining
  free software projects who had not to sacrifice the goals of the
  movement.


He concludes with a request for individuals who have been donating to GnuPG
to redirect their generosity toward another deserving project.  This is
good news; GnuPG ran on a shoestring for far too long.</span>

	With 4 development versions released already, you know that we are

	Some features took a lot of time, mostly when we changed core
	logics. I am thinking in particular about the code for
	multi-selection of layers. It’s not that selecting multiple items
	in a list is hard to implement, it’s that any feature in the whole
	application has been forever expecting just one layer or one
	channel selected. So what happens when there are 2, 3 or any number
	of items selected? Every feature, every tool, every plug-in and
	filter has to be rethought for this new use case.</span>

                    <span>C++ not only grows with cool features but also improves and makes code simpler and readable. It’s evident in template code. For example, typename inside dependent names is now much easier (not) to use.
If you have an expression like X::name, should you always put typename in front?

A few weeks ago, I experimented with a code kata and implemented a container and an iterator for “vectors of vectors.” I set the C++20 flag in Compiler Explorer wrote the code. But then I tried the C++17 flag, and I was surprised to see how much I had to add to compile it!
To simplify things, let’s look at a simple wrapper for a container class. It uses std::vector as internal storage and only exposes some essential functionality.

                    <span>Kernel developer Ingo Molnar has been quiet for a while; now we know why.
He has just announced a massive
set of patches (touching over half of the files in the kernel tree)
reworking how header files are handled.


	The fast-headers tree offers a +50-80% improvement in absolute
	kernel build performance on supported architectures, depending on
	the config. This is a major step forward in terms of Linux kernel
	build efficiency &amp; performance.

	A justified question would be: why on Earth 2,200 commits??


It seems likely that interesting conversations will follow; stay tuned.</span>

source into source control alongside the image in case I need to make

its source file. I’ve thought it would be convenient if the raster image
somehow contained its own source as metadata so that they don’t get
separated. I looked around and wasn’t satisfied with the solutions I
found, so I wrote one: pngattach.
My approach introduces a new private chunk type atCh (“attachment”)
which contains a file name, a flag to indicate if the attachment is
compressed, and an optionally DEFLATE-compressed blob of file contents. I

                    <span>When the goal is to push bits over the network as fast as the hardware can
go, any overhead hurts.  The cost of copying data to be transmitted
from user space into the kernel can be especially painful; it adds latency,
takes
valuable CPU time, and can be hard on cache performance.  So it is
unsurprising that the developers working with io_uring, which is all about performance, have
turned their attention to zero-copy network transmission.  This
patch set from Pavel Begunkov, now in its second revision, looks to be
significantly faster than the MSG_ZEROCOPY option supported by current
kernels.</span>

                    <span>A hard reality of C and C++ software development on Windows is that there
has never been a good, native C or C++ standard library implementation for
the platform. A standard library should abstract over the underlying host
facilities in order to ease portable software development. On Windows, C
and C++ is so poorly hooked up to operating system interfaces that most
portable or mostly-portable software — programs which work perfectly
elsewhere — are subtly broken on Windows, particularly outside of the
English-speaking world. The reasons are almost certainly political,
originally motivated by vendor lock-in, than technical, which adds insult
to injury. This article is about what’s wrong, how it’s wrong, and some
easy techniques to deal with it in portable software.

                    <span>AWS(Amazon Web Services)는 한마디로 말해서 아마존의 재발명(ReInvent)이다. 이유는 2006년 아마존의 한 부서에서 아마존 자체 웹 서비스를 사용하기 위해 아마존 S3(AWS Simple Storage Service)나 EC2(Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud)와 같은 다양한 표준 컴퓨팅 서비스를 재발명했기 때문이다. 이렇듯 클라우드 컴퓨팅의 여명으로 재발명된 AWS는 컴퓨터에 의존하는 비즈니스 경제를 근본적으로 바꿔 놓았다. 초기 인터넷 기업가들은 엔지니어링 시간과 노력의 70%를 데이터 […]</span>

                    <span>The kernel&#x27;s thread model is relatively straightforward and performs
reasonably well, but that&#x27;s not enough for all users.  Specifically, there
are use cases out there that benefit from a lightweight threading model
that gives user space control over scheduling decisions.  Back in May 2021,
Peter Oskolkov posted a patch set implementing an abstraction known as user-managed
concurrency groups, or UMCG.  Several revisions later, many observers
still lack a clear idea of what this patch is supposed to do, much less
whether it is a good idea for the kernel.  Things have taken a turn,
though, with Peter Zijlstra&#x27;s reimplementation
of UMCG.</span>

Jami is a GNU package for universal communication that respects the
freedom and privacy of its users.  Jami is an end-to-end encrypted
secure and distributed voice, video, and chat communication platform
that requires no central server, and leaves the power of privacy and
freedom in the hands of users.


Another recent blog post gives an overview of Jami for video conferences. The new release has improvements throughout the system, including the first phase of Swarm support, which are &quot;fully distributed, peer-to-peer chats with conversation
    histories synchronized across your devices, and the potential to
    be expanded into group chats in upcoming future releases of Jami&quot;.</span>

                    <span>Systemd 250 has been released.  To say that the list of new features is
long would be a severe understatement; the developers have clearly been
busy.



	systemd-homed now makes use of UID mapped mounts for the home areas.
          If the kernel and used file system support it, files are now
          internally owned by the &quot;nobody&quot; user (i.e. the user typically used
          for indicating &quot;this ownership is not mapped&quot;), and dynamically
          mapped to the UID used locally on the system via the UID mapping
          mount logic of recent kernels. This makes migrating home areas
          between different systems cheaper because recursively chown()ing file
          system trees is no longer necessary.

ID-mapped mounts).</span>

another year — LWN&#x27;s 22nd year of publication.  That can only mean one
thing: it is time to take a look back at our
ill-advised attempt to make predictions in January and see how it all
worked out.  Shockingly, some of those predictions were at least partially
on the mark.  Others were ... not quite so good.</span>

                    <span>Back at the beginning of 2020, it was predicted that retirements would increase
during this decade.  In 2021, the prediction
was that retirements would increase over the next couple of years. It is
happening and LWN is no exception.  I am retiring at the end of this year
after more than 20 years with LWN.

So who am I and how did I get here?  To some, I&#x27;m a name at the bottom of
some LWN page. To a few, I&#x27;m the one that reminds them when their LWN group
subscription is about to expire. You might have even met me at a
conference. Not that I have been to very many.  Mostly I tend to be quietly
in the background watching the LWN mailbox, looking for brief items and
quotes of the week (sorry I haven&#x27;t found much lately), proofreading
articles, managing subscriptions, and more. But I&#x27;m older than most of you
and this is my last LWN weekly edition.  Getting here is a bit of story.</span>

                    <span>Fedora is among the group of Linux distributions that, by default, lock
out the root account such that it does not have a password and cannot be
logged into.  But, traditionally, &quot;rescue mode&quot; boots the system into
single-user
mode, which requires a root password—difficult to provide if it 
does not exist.  A Fedora proposal to remove the need for the password in
that case, and just drop into a root shell, does not seem likely to go far
in that form,
but it would seem to have pointed toward some better solutions for the
underlying problem.</span>

                    <span>한국은 1948년 건국 이래 1960~1961년 제2공화국을 제외하고는 대통령제를 채택해 왔다. 그동안 한국 대통령 중 다수는 비극적으로 생을 마감해 왔다. 특히 1987년 민주화 이후에도 대통령제는 큰 변화 없이 유지되었고, 역대 대통령들은 재임 이후 평안한 삶을 영위하지 못하였다. 왜 그랬으며, 앞으로는 어떨까? 지금 두 명의 주요 후보가 대권을 위해 경쟁하고 있는데, 문재인 대통령과 다음 대통령의 말로는 과연 […]</span>

                    <span>The Linux Foundation has announced
the posting of a report on its research into diversity, equity, and
inclusion in open-source communities.


The research shows that while
a majority of respondents feel welcome in open source, many in
underrepresented communities do not. We hope that the data and insights
that this project provides will be a catalyst for strengthening existing
DEI initiatives and creating new ones.

browser&#x27;s extension API was not the first such—from the EFF or from
others.  The time of the switch to Manifest
V3, as the new API is known, is growing closer; privacy advocates are
concerned that it will preclude a number of techniques that browser
extensions use for features like ad and tracker blocking.  Part of the
concern stems from the fact that Google is both the developer of a popular
web browser and the operator of an enormous advertising network so its
incentives seem, at least, plausibly misaligned.</span>

Every developer’s path to pursuing a career in tech can be traced back to a single moment. Such is the case for Ning Zhang, a developer from China, who found his early interest in web development as a high schooler at the age of fifteen. Ning built his first website for his English class to help his classmates succeed with their studies. He didn’t realize it at the time, but he was only just getting started. Throughout high school, he played with Google Webmaster Tools (now Google Search Console) and Google Adsense to create and manage numerous other websites for fun. Like so many aspiring developers before him, Ning knew he’d found his passion, but the path ahead remained unclear.

                    <span>It’s almost the end of the year! As usual, I started writing my “year” summary that I will publish on the 31st of December.
Yet, this article won’t be possible without your input!
I have a survey with just nine questions about C++ and your experience in 2021.
Questions:
C++ Standard used
Your experience with C++17, C++20
Compiler used
IDE and tools
Best thing that happened
It should take no more than 5 minutes :)
Please note that this survey is not an official ISO C++ survey. It’s solely for the blog.

                    <span>The 5.16-rc6 kernel prepatch is out for
testing.


	Regardless of what happens, I will be making an rc8 - not because
	this release looks particularly problematic, but simply due to the
	seasonal holidays. There&#x27;s no point in releasing a final 5.16 and
	opening the merge window when people are still on holiday or just
	coming back. So we&#x27;ll have at least one extra week of rc this
	release, even if no nasty issues appear.</span>
