	And I know some people will wonder why we spent so much time
	working with NVidia around their binary driver, but the reality is
	that NVidia is the market leader, especially in the professional
	Linux workstation space, and there are lot of people who either
	would end up not using Linux or using Linux with X without it,
	including a lot of Red Hat customers and Fedora users. And that is
	what I and my team are here for at the end of the day, to make sure

                    <span>Ariadne Conill looks
at the difficulties caused by the OpenSSL 3 transition in the
context of Alpine Linux.


	For distributions, however, the story is different:
	cryptography moved to using Rust, because they wanted to
	leverage all of the static analysis capabilities built into the
	language.  This, too, is a reasonable decision, from a development
	perspective.  From the ecosystem perspective, however, it is
	problematic, as the Rust ecosystem is still rapidly evolving, and
	so we cannot support a single branch of the Rust compiler for an
	entire 2 year lifecycle, which means it exists in community.  Our
	solution, historically, has been to hold cryptography at
	the latest version that did not require Rust to build.  However,
	that version is not compatible with OpenSSL 3, and so it will
	eventually need to be upgraded to a new version which is.  And so,
	since cryptography has to move to community, so does
	paramiko and Ansible.</span>

                    <span>The first day of the online Kangrejos conference was focused on
introducing the effort to bring the Rust programming language into the 
Linux kernel.  On the second day, conference organizer Miguel Ojeda shifted
to presenting the Rust language itself with an emphasis on what Rust can
provide for kernel development.  The result was a useful resource for
anybody who is curious about this project, but who has not yet had the time
to become familiar with Rust.</span>

                    <span>C++20 Coroutines
There seems to be a lot of confusion around the implementation of C++20 coroutines, which I think is due to the draft technical specification for C++20 stating that coroutines are a work in progress so we can’t expect full compiler and library support at this point in time.
A lot of the problems probably arise from the lack of official documentation about working with coroutines. We have been given C++ syntax support for coroutines (the co_yield and co_return) but without [...]

                    <span>This article was discussed on Hacker News.
Years ago, OpenBSD gained two new security system calls, pledge(2)
(originally tame(2)) and unveil. In both, an application
surrenders capabilities at run-time. The idea is to perform initialization
like usual, then drop capabilities before handling untrusted input,
limiting unwanted side effects. This feature is applicable even where type
safety isn’t an issue, such as Python, where a program might still get
tricked into accessing sensitive files or making network connections when
it shouldn’t. So how can a Python program access these system calls?
As discussed previously, it’s quite easy to access C APIs from
Python through its ctypes package, and this is no exception.

is a flexible tool for managing issues via the web or

methodology. The 20th-anniversary
edition of
Roundup,
version 2.1.0, was
released in July; it is a maintenance release, but there have been a number
of larger improvements in the last year or so. Here we introduce

                    <span>My friend over at Possibly Wrong created a code name generator. By
coincidence I happened to be thinking about code names myself while
recently replaying XCOM: Enemy Within (2012/2013). The game
generates a random code name for each mission, and I wondered how often it
repeats. The UFOpaedia page on the topic gives the word lists: 53
adjectives and 76 nouns, for a total of 4028 possible code names. A
typical game has around 60 missions, and if code names are generated
naively on the fly, then per the birthday paradox around half of all games
will see a repeated mission code name! Fortunately this is easy to avoid,
and the particular configuration here lends itself to an interesting
implementation.
Mission code names are built using “adjective noun”. Some examples
from the game’s word list:…</span>

How the idea emerged
With the advancement of technology, drones have become not only smaller, but also have more compute. There are many examples of iPhone-sized quadcopters in the consumer drone market and the computing power to do live tracking while recording 4K video. However, the most important element has not changed much - the controller. It is still bulky and not intuitive for beginners to use. There is a smartphone with on-display control as an option; however, the control principle is still the same.  
That is how the idea for this project emerged: a more personalised approach t…</span>

	So 5.15 isn&#x27;t shaping up to be a particularly large release, at
	least in number of commits. At only just over 10k non-merge
	commits, this is in fact the smallest rc1 we have had in the 5.x
	series. We&#x27;re usually hovering in the 12-14k commit range.

	That said, counting commits isn&#x27;t necessarily the best measure, and

                    <span>Running small machine learning models on embedded devices has become a rich topic of research and investment, both at large tech companies and in academia. It’s not really mainstream yet, but it’s possible that the use cases where TinyML delivers the most value aren’t necessarily found in rich countries with robust infrastructure and bigger budgets […]

                    <span>Two keywords, constexpr and virtual - can those two work together? Virtual implies runtime polymorphism, while constexpr suggests constant expression evaluation. It looks like we have a contradiction, does it?
Read on and see why those conflicting terms might help us get simpler code.
A basic example
Imagine that you work with some product list, and you want to check if a product fits in a given box size:
#include 

struct Box {
  double width{0.0};
  double height{0.0};
  double length{0.0};
};

struct Product {
  virtual ~Product() &#x3D; default;

  virtual Box getBox() const noexcept &#x3D; 0;
};

struct Notebook : public Product {
  Box getBox() const noexcept override {
    return {.width &#x3D; 30.0, .height &#x3D; 2.0, .length &#x3D; 30.0};
  }

                    <span>The Linux Foundation has announced that  Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX) has become an international standard (ISO/IEC 5962:2021).  SPDX has been used in the kernel and other projects to identify the licenses and attach other metadata to  software components.

Between eighty and ninety percent (80%-90%) of a modern application is assembled from open source software components. An SBOM [software bill of materials] accounts for the software components contained in an application — open source, proprietary, or third-party — and details their provenance, license, and security attributes. SBOMs are used as a part of a foundational practice to track and trace components across software supply chains. SBOMs also help to proactively identify software issues and risks and establish a starting point for their remediation.

SPDX results from ten years of collaboration from representatives across industries, including the leading Software Composition Analysis (SCA) vendors – making it the most robust, mature, and adopted SBOM standard.</span>

track to be pulled into the mainline during the 5.15 merge window.  Matthew
Wilcox duly sent a pull
request in August to make that happen.  While it is possible that
folios could still end up in 5.15, that has not happened as of this writing
and appears increasingly unlikely.  What we got instead was a lengthy
discussion on the merits of the folio approach.</span>

                    <span>This blog post by
Loris Cro makes the claim that the Zig
language  is
the solution to a lot of low-level programming problems:


	Freeing the art of systems programming from the grips of C/C++
	cruft is the only way to push for real change in our industry, but
	rewriting everything is not the answer. In the Zig project we’re
	making the C/C++ ecosystem more fun and productive. Today we have a
	compiler, a linker and a build system, and soon we’ll also have a
	package manager, making Zig a complete toolchain that can fetch
	dependencies and build C/C++/Zig projects from any target, for any
	target.


(LWN looked at Zig last year).</span>

                    <span>The Linux extended-attribute mechanism allows the attachment of metadata to
files within a filesystem.  It tends to be little used — at least, in the
absence of a security module like SELinux.  There is interest in how these
attributes work, though, as evidenced by the discussions that have
followed the posting of revisions of this
patch by Vivek Goyal, which seeks to make a seemingly small change to
the rules regarding extended attributes and special files.</span>

certain extent; both referred to Python&#x27;s style guide, but the discussion
indicates that the advice in it may have been stretched further than intended.   PEP 8
(&quot;Style Guide for Python Code&quot;) is the longstanding set of
guidelines and suggestions for code that is going into the standard
library, but the &quot;rules&quot; in the PEP have been applied in settings and tools well outside of that
realm.  There may be reasons to update the PEP—some unrelated work of that nature is
ongoing, in fact—but Pythonistas need to remember that the suggestions in
it are not carved in stone.</span>

You can get this new release while is still fresh here:
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100rc2/
This release, 3.10.0rc2, is the last preview before the final release of Python 3.10.0 on 2021-10-04. Entering the release candidate phase, only reviewed code changes which are clear bug fixes are allowed between release candidates and the final release. There will be no ABI changes from this point forward in the 3.10 series and the goal is that there will be as few code changes as possible.

contacts.  Even hams who still prefer to talk or use Morse code may still
use computers for some things, such as logging contacts or predicting
radio conditions. While most hams use Windows, there is no shortage of ham

                    <span>Version 3.0 of the OpenSSL TLS library has been released; the large
version-number jump (from 1.1.1) reflects a new versioning scheme.


	Most applications that worked with OpenSSL 1.1.1 will still work
	unchanged and will simply need to be recompiled (although you may
	see numerous compilation warnings about using deprecated
	APIs). Some applications may need to make changes to compile and
	work correctly, and many applications will need to be changed to
	avoid the deprecations warnings. We have put together a migration 
	guide to describe the major differences in OpenSSL 3.0 compared to
	previous releases.


OpenSSL has also been relicensed to Apache 2.0, which should end the era of
&quot;special exceptions&quot; needed to use OpenSSL in GPL-licensed applications.

blog entry and the changelog for

                    <span>Over the past year or two, we’ve talked about blockchain in combination with the Internet of Things numerous times. But to really understand how the blockchain can help improve device security and the IoT experience, you first have to understand what the blockchain is. With that in mind, here’s a brief overview along with some examples, so […]

                    <span>Once upon a time, block storage devices were slow, to the point that they
often limited the speed of the system as a whole.  A great deal of effort
went into carefully ordering requests to get the best performance out of
the storage device; achieving that goal was well worth expending some CPU
time.  But then storage devices got much faster and the equation changed.
Fancy I/O-scheduling mechanisms have fallen by the wayside and effort is now
focused on optimizing code so that the CPU can keep up with its storage.  A
block-layer change that was merged for the 5.15 kernel shows the kinds of
tradeoffs that must be made to get the best performance from current hardware.</span>

In June this year we opened applications for our Indie Games Accelerator, a mentorship program to help top mobile game startups achieve their full potential, as well as for our Indie Games Festival, a competition open to small game studios who get the opportunity to win promotions and be featured on Google Play. These annual programs are part of our commitment to helping all developers thrive in the Google ecosystem. 
We received thousands of applications from developers across the world and we were truly amazed by the response. We’re impressed by the innovation and passion of the indie game community, and the unique and creative games they bring to players worldwide.  
Last month we announced the Festival finalists …</span>

seems, developers who find the idea useful enough to not only overcome the
initial cognitive dissonance that comes with it, but also to resurrect an
eight-year-old patch to get it into the kernel.</span>

                    <span>On the ADA Logics blog, David Korczynski and Adam Korczynski write about their work integrating 115 open-source projects with Google&#x27;s OSS-Fuzz project for doing continuous fuzz testing.    They describe the process of integrating a project into OSS-Fuzz, and discuss their findings, which include more than 2000 bugs (500+ security relevant), of which 1300+ have been fixed at this point:

Throughout the process we integrated projects written in C, C++, Python, Go and Rust and the types of bugs we found across the projects are a reflection of the language the project was written in. Typically, for managed languages the bugs are within the umbrella term of uncaught exceptions and denial of service bugs, whereas in native languages the bugs are mostly split between assert violations, NULL-dereferences, heap-out-of-bounds, stack-out-of-bounds, stack overflows, integer arithmetic, memory leaks, out-of-memory and timeout bugs.</span>

 An easier yet still optional migration
  
In the previous episode of the Serverless Migration Station video series, developers learned how to containerize their App Engine code for Cloud Run using Docker. While Docker has gained popularity over the past decade, not everyone has containers integrated into their daily development workflow, and some prefer &quot;containerless&quot; solutions but know that containers can be beneficial. Well today&#x27;s video is just for you, showing how you can still get your apps onto Cloud Run, even If you don&#x27;t have much experience with Docker, containers, nor Dockerfiles. 
App Engine isn&#x27;t going away as Google has expressed long-term support for legacy runtimes on the platform, so those who prefer sour…</span>

                    <span>Discussions on ways to  &quot;modernize&quot; the Emacs editor have come up in various guises over the past few
years.  Changes of that nature tend to be somewhat contentious in the Emacs
community, pitting the &quot;old guard&quot; that values the existing features (and
keybindings) against those who argue for changes to make Emacs more
approachable (and aesthetically pleasing) to newcomers.  Those discussions
tend toward mega-thread status, so it should be no surprise that a query
about possibly moving Emacs development to a &quot;forge&quot; (e.g. GitHub or GitLab) got
similar treatment.  As always in Emacs-land, there are multiple facets to
the discussion, including the desirability of moving away from an
email-based workflow, accommodating younger, forge-centric developers
without forcing existing developers into that model, and—naturally—licensing.</span>

                    <span>Not everyone enjoys working in support. Many people who work there experience burnout. So maybe companies shouldn&#x27;t have any support at all? How do they benefit from it? Is there a way to prevent burnout while working in support? Let&#x27;s try to find the answers.</span>

the purpose of its copyright policies and examines the impact of

For some GNU packages, the ones that are FSF-copyrighted, we ask contributors for two kinds of legal papers: copyright assignments, and employer copyright disclaimers. We drew up these policies working with lawyers in the 1980s, and they make possible our steady and continuing enforcement of the GNU General Public License (GPL).

installation mechanisms (primarily pip, but there are others) looks
on its way to being resolved—or at least regularized.  PEP 668
(&quot;Graceful cooperation between external and Python package
managers&quot;) has been created to provide ways for the two types of package installation
to
work together, rather than at cross-purposes at times.
Since many operating systems depend on Python tools, with package versions
that may differ from those of users&#x27; Python applications, making them play together
nicely should result in more stable systems.</span>

                    <span>The 5.15 merge window is off to a fast start; stay tuned for our usual full
summary.  It is worth mentioning, though, that the realtime preemption
locking code has been pulled into the
mainline with little fanfare.  This 
work began in 2004 and has fundamentally
changed many parts of the core kernel.  With this pull, the sleepable locks
that make deterministic realtime response possible have finally joined all
of that other work (though the kernel must be built with the
REALTIME configuration option to use them).

Congratulations are due to all of the realtime developers who pushed this
project forward for nearly two decades.</span>

Python 3.9.7 is the newest major stable release of 
the Python programming language, and it contains many new features and 
optimizations. There’s been 187 commits since 3.9.6 which is a similar 
amount compared to 3.8 at the same stage of the release cycle. See the change log for details.

On macOS, we encourage you to use the universal2 binary installer variant whenever possible. The legacy 10.9+ Intel-only variant will not be provided for Python 3.10 and the universal2 variant will become the default download for 3.9.8. You may need to upgrade third-party components, like pip,

                    <span>constexpr started small in C++11 but then, with each Standard revision, improved considerably. In C++20, we can say that there’s a culmination point as you can even use std::vector and std::string in constant expressions!
Let’s look at use cases, required features to make it work, and finally, one significant limitation that we might want to solve in the future.
Sidenote: is my code run at constexpr?
Before we dive into fun stuff with vectors, it would be good to set some background.
In short: even if your function is marked with constexpr, it doesn’t mean it will always be executed at compile-time.
constexpr function can be both executed at compile-time and runtime.
For example:
constexpr int sum(unsigned int n) {
    return (n*(n+1))/2;
}

                    <span>Linus has released the 5.14 kernel.


	So I realize you must all still be busy with all the galas and
	fancy balls and all the other 30th anniversary events, but at some
	point you must be getting tired of the constant glitz, the
	fireworks, and the champagne. That ball gown or tailcoat isn&#x27;t the
	most comfortable thing, either. The celebrations will go on for a
	few more weeks yet, but you all may just need a breather from them.

	And when that happens, I have just the thing for you - a new kernel
	release to test and enjoy.


Headline features in 5.14 include:
core scheduling (at last),
the burstable CFS bandwidth controller,
some initial infrastructure for BPF program
loaders,
the rq_qos
I/O priority policy,
some improvements to the
SO_REUSEPORT networking option,
the control-group &quot;kill&quot; button,
the memfd_secret() system call,
the quotactl_fd() system call,
and much more.  See the LWN merge-window summaries (part 1, part 2) for more details.</span>

More bluntly, in a recent conversation with a newsletter author, his comment on some future measurement projects I wanted to do (in the same vein as other projects like keyboard vs. mouse, keyboard, terminal and end-to-end latency measurements) was, &quot;so you just want to get to the top of Hacker News?&quot;
The implication for the former is that measuring is less valuable than building and for the latter that measuring isn&#x27;t valuable at all (perhaps other than for fame), but I don&#x27;t see measuring as lesser let alone worthless. If anything, because measurement is, like writing, not generally valued, it&#x27;s much easier to find high ROI measurement projects than high ROI building projects.

(Power Law에 따라, Uber같이 실패 가능성이 아주 높지만 성공하면 ‘초대박’이 될 가능성을 찾는 경향이 강한 미국 VC들에게는 이 것이 가장 중요한 질문의 하나이지만, 투자 기준, 목표가 좀 다른 국내 VC에게 똑같이 적용되지 않을 수 있음)</span>

                    <span>As a general rule, the kernel community is happy to merge working device
drivers without much concern for the availability of any associated
user-space code.  What happens in user space is beyond the kernel&#x27;s concern
and unaffected by the kernel&#x27;s license.  There is an exception, though, in
the form of drivers for graphical processors (GPUs), which cannot be merged
in the absence of a working, freely-licensed user-space component.  The
question of which drivers are subject to that rule has come up a few times
in recent years; that discussion has now come to a decision point with an
effort to block some
Habana Labs driver updates from entry into the 5.15 kernel.</span>

Nowadays, the Linux kernel is a huge project used by millions. We checked the kernel 5 years ago. So, we can&#x27;t miss this event and want to look at the code of this epic project again.</span>

                    <span>2012년 8월 30일, 국민을 경악하게 만든 사건이 벌어졌습니다. 범인 고종석은 일가족이 자고 있는 집에 침입해 7살 아동을 이불 채 납치하고 성폭행했습니다. 사건 1년 후 피해 아동의 가족은 한 토론회에서 “고종석보다 더 나쁜 건 언론”이라고 울분을 토했습니다. 도대체 언론이 어떻게 했길래 피해자 가족에게 아동 성폭행 가해자만큼이나 원한을 사게 되었을까요. 당시 언론은 ‘광풍’이라는 표현조차 부족할 정도로 […]</span>

                    <span>A regression that was recently reported for 5.14 in the media
subsystem is a bit of a strange beast.  The kernel&#x27;s user-space binary 
interface (ABI) was not changed, which is the usual test for a patch to get
reverted, but the report still led to a reversion.  The change did lead to
problems building a user-space application because it moved some header
files to staging/ as part of a cleanup for a deprecated—though
apparently still functioning—driver for a Digital
Video Broadcasting (DVB) device.  There are a few different issues
tangled together here, but the reversion of a regression in the user-space
API (and not ABI) is a new wrinkle.</span>

	The TAB serves as the interface between the kernel development

	the community, and working to resolve community-related problems
	(preferably before they get out of hand). We also support the Code

The election itself will be held during the Linux Plumbers Conference, 
September 20 to 24.  Note that the

So in this tutorial, I want to start explaining how you can use the golang.org/x/text packages for i18n and l10n in your code, and in particular, how to work with them in the context of a web application.

 Earlier this summer we shared details about how the Google for Startups Accelerator program is expanding its support for founders from underrepresented groups. In addition to our Black Founders accelerator program, the expansion included a second year of programming specifically designed for women-led startups in North America.  
We launched the inaugural Google for Startups Accelerator: Women Founders program in 2020, in order to address gender disparity in the startup ecosystem and provide high-quality mentorship opportunities and support for women founders. Studies showed that only 16% of small and medium sized businesses were owned by women, and that women often lack access to venture capitalist funding and acce…</span>

credentials to banned texts to family photos—that they might 
normally expect to be 
protected by the login password of their account.  Under some
circumstances, though, users can be required to log into their system so
that some third party (e.g. government agent) can examine and potentially
copy said data. A new project, PAM Duress, provides a way
to add other passwords to an account, each with its own behavior, which
might be a way to avoid granting full access to the system, though the
legality is in question.</span>

It has been on the OWASP Top 10 list (the list of the most critical security risks to web applications) for a while now. So let&#x27;s figure out together how your browser can acquire and execute a script from a third-party website, and what this may lead to (spoiler: your cookies could get stolen, for example).

The Google Developer Groups Spotlight series interviews inspiring leaders of community meetup groups around the world. Our goal is to learn more about what developers are working on, how they’ve grown their skills with the Google Developer Group community, and what tips they might have for us all. 
We recently spoke with Kose, community lead for Google Developer Groups Juba in South Sudan. Check out our conversation with Kose about building a GDG chapter, the future of GDG Juba, and the importance of growing the tech community in South Sudan.

                    <span>The first installment in this two-part
series looked at the difficulties that arise when Btrfs filesystems
containing subvolumes are exported via NFS.  Btrfs has a couple of quirks
that complicate life in this situation: the use of separate device numbers
for subvolumes and the lack of unique inode numbers across the filesystem
as a whole.  Recently, Neil Brown set off on an effort to try

The money from Andreessen was an investment in Helium Network Tokens (HNTs), not an investment in the company. However, Helium did wrap a small, undisclosed bit of outside funding from […]

                    <span>C++20 added a couple of new attributes in the form of [[attrib_name]]. One of them - [[no_unique_address]] - can have surprising effects on the code! In this blog post, you’ll learn how to optimize your classes&#x27; layout and make some data members “disappear”. In most cases, it will be just one line of C++20 code.
Let’s go.
A motivating example
unique_ptr is one of the most useful smart pointers and is also easy to use. It’s very flexible as you can even control the way the deleter works.
I wrote an article on that topic some time ago:
Custom Deleters for C++ Smart Pointers - unique_ptr
To recall the knowledge, let’s have a look at an example. There’s a legacy type LegacyList, and the users are obligated to call ReleaseElements before the list is deleted:

                    <span>I like to test my software across different environments, on strange
platforms, and with alternative implementations. Each has its
own quirks and oddities that can shake bugs out earlier. C is particularly
good at this since it has such a wide selection of compilers and runs on
everything. For instance I count at least 7 distinct C compilers in Debian
alone. One advantage of writing portable software is access to a
broader testing environment, and it’s one reason I prefer to target
standards rather than specific platforms.
However, I’ve long struggled with architecture diversity. My work and
testing has been almost entirely on x86, with ARM as a distant second
(Raspberry Pi and friends). Big endian hosts are particularly rare.
