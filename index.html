                    <span>The Virtuozzo team has announced
the release of VzLinux 8.4; its fork of RHEL. &quot;Thanks for noticing that we are fixing bugs so quickly (24 hours) and that you think VzLinux is stable and enterprise ready. To those who have asked if we will be following a similar path as CentOS, shifting its focus to Stream, the answer is: there are no plans for us to go this route, VzLinux will remain free to download, use and distribute.

Two other technologies deserve a mention as well: radar and ultra-wideband. Ultra-wideband, or UWB, […]

instead, is much more uncommon.  That appears likely to happen
soon, though, as discussions proceed on the removal of bdflush().

What is Art Filter?
  
One of the best ways to learn about global culture is by trying on famous art pieces using Google’s Augmented Reality technology on your mobile device. What does it feel like to wear a three thousand year old necklace, put on a sixteenth century Japanese helmet or don pearl earrings and pose in a Vermeer? 
Google Arts &amp; Culture have created a new feature called Art Filter allowing everyone to learn about culturally significant art pieces from around the world and put themselves inside famous paintings, normally safely displayed in a museum. 
We teamed up with the  MediaPipe team, which offers cross-platform, customizable ML solutions to combine ML with rendering to generate stunning visuals.

                    <span>Bradley Kuhn has posted a
lengthy missive on the Software Freedom Conservancy blog about the
hazards of distributed copyright ownership.


	As a result, in debates about copyright ownership, discussions of
	what policy contributors want regarding the fruits of their labor
	is sadly moot. Without a clear, organized mitigation strategy to
	assure that FOSS contributors keep their own copyrights, a project
	(such as GCC or glibc) that switches from a standing “(nearly) all
	copyrights assigned to a charity” model to a plain Developer
	Certificate of Origin (DCO) or naked inbound&#x3D;outbound contributor
	arrangement will, after a period of years, mostly likely to have
	copyrights that are primarily held by the employers of the most
	prolific contributors, rather than by the contributors themselves.</span>

Now that 
this work has reached a (presumably) final form, a look at why this feature
makes sense and how it works is warranted.  Core scheduling is not for
everybody, but it may prove to be quite useful for some user communities.</span>

Google has updated its Passes API to enable a simple and secure way to store and access COVID vaccination and test cards on Android devices. Starting today, developers from  healthcare organizations, government agencies and organizations authorized by public health authorities to distribute COVID vaccines and/or tests will have access to these APIs to create a digital version of COVID vaccination or test information. This will roll out initially in the United States followed by other countries.

Once a user stores the digital version of the COVID Card to their device, they will be able to access it via a shortcut on their device home screen, even when they are offl…</span>

                    <span>A new project from Mozilla, which is meant to help researchers collect
browsing data, but only with the informed consent of the browser-user, is taking a lot of
heat, perhaps in part because the company can never seem to do anything
right, at least in the
eyes of some.  Mozilla Rally was
announced
on June 25 as joint venture between the company and researchers at
Princeton University &quot;to enable crowdsourced science for public
good&quot;.   The idea is that users can volunteer to give academic studies access to
the same kinds of browser data that is being tracked in some browsers
today.  Whether the privacy safeguards are strong 
enough—and if there is sufficient reason for users to sign up—remains to be seen.</span>

                    <span>Over at the Project Zero blog, Felix Wilhelm posted a lengthy account of a vulnerability he found in the Linux kernel&#x27;s KVM (Kernel-based virtual machine) subsystem:

In this blog post I describe a vulnerability in KVM’s AMD-specific code and discuss how this bug can be turned into a full virtual machine escape. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first public writeup of a KVM guest-to-host breakout that does not rely on bugs in user space components such as QEMU. The discussed bug was assigned CVE-2021-29657, affects kernel versions v5.10-rc1 to v5.12-rc6 and was patched at the end of March 2021. As the bug only became exploitable in v5.10 and was discovered roughly 5 months later, most real world deployments of KVM should not be affected. I still think the issue is an interesting case study in the work required to build a stable guest-to-host escape against KVM and hope that this writeup can strengthen the case that hypervisor compromises are not only theoretical issues.</span>

                    <span>Each generation, companies like Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo delight their consumers with new consoles and different games for them. Yet there is a caveat - some games exclusively run on their platforms. Whereas a console may be worth an expensive PC component or a full-fledged computer. So what can you do? Emulators come to the rescue here. The market is full of similar projects, some are released as open source. Let us turn our attention to Nintendo Switch emulators. On the network, Ryujinx and Yuzu projects are among most popular responses. Let&#x27;s check the code of the Ryujinx emulator and find out how many interesting bugs can be found using static analysis.</span>

                    <span>Recently I wrote a cute little program for doing Turtle Graphics.  For those of you who don&#x27;t know, turtle graphics were originally added to the LOGO language by Seymour Papert in the late 1960s.  He built a robot that he called a &quot;turtle&quot; that could hold a pen.  The robot had wheels and could move forwards and backwards, and could rotate left and right.  It could also raise and lower the pen.  When placed on a sheet of paper, the turtle could be commanded to draw interesting designs.
Papert&#x27;s goal was to teach children about programming.  As the years went by the robot got replaced with screens, and the turtle became an icon that could draw lines.  Children from the 70s until now have been enthralled by the simple commands for directing the turtle, and the elegant drawings they can make.

 The Google Identity team is continually working to improve Google Account security and create a safer and more secure experience for our users. As part of that work, we recently introduced a new secure browser policy prohibiting Google OAuth requests in embedded browser libraries commonly referred to as embedded webviews. All embedded webviews will be blocked starting on September 30, 2021. 
Embedded webview libraries are problematic because they allow a nefarious developer to intercept and alter communications between Google and its users by acting as a &quot;man in the middle.&quot; An application embedding a webview can modify or intercept network requests, insert custom scripts that can potentially record every keystroke entered in a login…</span>

With 1,600 students by his side, Jack Lee grew the largest Google Developer Student Club in the world in just 6 months at the London School of Economics (LSE). A life-long athlete, who loves leading teams, Jack saw that reigniting his university’s GDSC would be a great opportunity to have a large impact on the local tech scene. With a heavy focus on partnerships, Jack connected members of his club with leaders at top companies and other student groups across Scotland, France, Norway, Canada, and Nigeria. These collaborations enabled students to practice networking, while gaining access to key internships.

minimally safe on today&#x27;s internet.  Products that have reached their &quot;end

bombs—it is only a matter of time before they are vulnerable to
attack.  That situation played out in June for owners of  Western
Digital (WD) My Book Live network-attached storage (NAS) devices; what was
meant to be a disk for home users 
accessible via the internet turned into a black hole when a remote
command-execution flaw was used to delete all of the data stored there.  Or

(DLLs) using w64devkit. These techniques also apply to other
circumstances, including with languages and ecosystems outside of C and
C++. In particular, w64devkit is a great complement to Go and reliably
fullfills all the needs of cgo — Go’s C interop — and can even
bootstrap Go itself. As before, this article is in large part an exercise
in capturing practical information I’ve picked up over time.
Go: bootstrap and cgo
The primary Go implementation, confusingly named “gc”, is an
incredible piece of software engineering. This is apparent when
building the Go toolchain itself, a process that is fast, reliable, easy,
and simple. It was originally written in C, but was re-written in Go
starting with Go 1.5. The C compiler i…</span>

                    <span>Posted by Rodrigo Akira Hirooka, Program Manager, Google Developer Groups Latin America 
 Lorena Locks is on a mission to grow the LGBTQIA+ tech community in Brazil. Her inspiration came from hosting Google Developer Group (GDG) Floripa meetups with her friend Catarina, where they were able to identify a need in their community.  
     
“We felt there wasn&#x27;t a forum to meet people in the tech industry that reflected ourselves. So we decided to think bigger.”

Pride Week at GDG Floripa and Belo Horizonte, Brazil 
  
As a Women Techmakers Ambassador and Google Developer Group lead in Floripa, Brazil,  Lorena worked with the local community to create a week of special events, including over 12 talks and sessions centered on empowering the LGBTQIA+ experience in tech.  
The events took place every night at 7pm from June 21st - 25th and focused on creating inclusive representation and building trust among developer communities.  
     
Lorena’s commitment to this underrepresented group gained the attention of many local leaders in tech who identify as LGBTQIA+ and volunteered as speakers during Pride Week.
     
By creating spaces to talk about important LGBTQIA+ topics in tech, Pride Week events included sessions on: 
 
Spotting binary designs in products  
How to build inclusive tech teams  
Being an LGBTQIA+ manager   
Developing &#x27;Nohs Somos&#x27; an app for the LGBTQIA+ community  
The best practices for D&amp;I   
General Personal Data Protection Law and inclusive gender questions on forms 
  

 
  Speakers in photo: Lorena Locks and Catarina Schein  
  
With one-hundred percent of the speakers at these events coming from the LGTBQIA+ community, Pride Week at GDG Floripa and Belo Horizonte was a high impact program that has gone on to inspire GDGs around the world.

the Python programming language, and it contains many new features and 
optimizations. There’s been 146 commits since 3.9.5 which is a similar 
amount compared to 3.8 at the same stage of the release cycle. See the change log for details.

On macOS, we encourage you to use the universal2 binary installer variant whenever possible. The legacy 10.9+ Intel-only variant will not be provided for Python 3.10 and the universal2 variant will become the default download for future 3.9.x releases. You may need to upgrade third-party components, like pip,
 to later versions once they are released. You may experience 
differences in behavior in IDLE and other Tk-bas…</span>

                    <span>2018년 서지현 검사의 검찰 성추행 은폐 사건 고발로 촉발된 미투운동은 우리 사회에 여전히 성폭력, 차별이 만연하다는 현실을 보여줬습니다. 미투운동은 페미니즘을 한국 사회 담론으로 확장했고, 온·오프라인에서 페미니즘 운동이 본격화됐습니다. 그러자 성평등을 향한 페미니즘에 대한 반발성 공격으로서 ‘백래시’가 등장했습니다. 성평등 운동이 일으키는 변화로 자신의 사회적 영향력이 줄어든다고 느끼는 이들의 반발 현상을 말합니다. 백래시는 성폭력 피해자를 공격하거나 피해자에게 […]</span>

                    <span>The KernelCI continuous-integration project held
its first hackfest recently.  Developers from the KernelCI team,
Google, and Collabora worked to improve many different aspects of KernelCI
testing capabilities.  There are plans for more hackfests.

The first-ever KernelCI hackfest was a success. It kicked off the work to enable kernel testing through Chromium OS, a product-specific userspace. Enabling full userspace images and real-world tests like video call simulations adds a lot of complexity to the testing process. However, the benefits are a clear win for the community. They allow a more thorough kernel testing and validation through real application use cases, which can exercise several different kernel areas at the same time in an organized manner. Generally, it is not simple for lower-level kernel test suites like kselftests or LTP to orchestrate a similar use case.</span>

                    <span>Linus has released the 5.13 kernel.


Of course, if the last week was small and calm, 5.13 overall is
actually fairly large. In fact, it&#x27;s one of the bigger 5.x releases,
with over 16k commits (over 17k if you count merges), from over 2k
developers. But it&#x27;s a &#x27;big all over&#x27; kind of thing, not something
particular that stands out as particularly unusual.




Headline features in this release include
the &quot;misc&quot; group controller,
multiple
sources for trusted keys,
kernel
stack randomization on every system call,
support for Clang control-flow integrity
enforcement,
the ability to call kernel functions
directly from BPF programs,
minor-fault
handling for userfaultfd(),
the removal of /dev/kmem,
the Landlock security module,
and, of course, thousands of cleanups and fixes.</span>

                    <span>I wrote my first program in 1964.  The name of the program was: Mr Patternson&#x27;s Computerized Gate, and it was implemented on a little plastic computer named DIGICOMP-I, which was a cute little three bit finite state machine with 6 AND gates.
The first electronic computer I ever wrote a program for was an ECP-18 in 1966.  This was a 15 bit wide machine with 1024 words of drum memory.  The programs I wrote were all in binary machine language and were entered through the front-panel switches.
In the years between 1967 and 1969 my father would drive my friend, Tim Conrad, and I 25 miles to the Digital Equipment Corp sales office, where we would spend our Saturdays entering programs into the PDP-8 that they had on the floor.

 Important update for the Dev Board / SoM
 If you have a Coral Dev Board or Coral SoM, please install our latest Mendel update as soon as possible to receive a critical fix to part of the SoC power configuration. To get it, just log onto your board and install the update as follows: 
  

     
This will install a patch from NXP for the Dev Board / SoM&#x27;s SoC, without which it&#x27;s possible the SoC will overstress and the lifetime of the device could be reduced. If you recently flashed your board with t…</span>

                    <span>Over on the Mozilla blog, the company has announced a new platform, Mozilla Rally, that &quot;puts users in control of their data and empowers them to contribute their browsing data to crowdfund projects for a better Internet and a better society&quot;.  Rally comes out of work that Mozilla did with Professor Jonathan Mayer&#x27;s research group at Princeton University .

Your data is valuable. But for too long, online services have pilfered, swapped, and exploited your data without your awareness. Privacy violations and filter bubbles are all consequences of a surveillance data economy. But what if, instead of companies taking your data without giving you a say, you could select who gets access to your data and put it to work for public good?

[...] By leveraging the scale of web browsers – a piece of software used by billions of people around the world – Rally has the potential to help address societal problems we could not solve before. Our goal is to demonstrate that there is a case for an equitable market for data, one where every party is treated fairly, and we welcome mission-aligned organizations that want to join us on this journey.</span>

system call creates a mapping for a range of virtual addresses; it
has a long list of options controlling just how that mapping should work.
Ming Lin is proposing
the addition of yet another option, called MAP_NOSIGBUS, which
changes the kernel&#x27;s response when a process accesses an unmapped address.
What this option does is relatively easy to understand; why it is 
useful takes a bit more explanation.</span>

the release of a schema intended to describe vulnerabilities in a

                    <span>The first stable release of MyGNUHealth is out.


I am proud to announce the first stable release of MyGNUHealth, the GNU
Health Personal Health Record for desktop and mobile devices.

From now on, anyone can benefit from a Libre Personal Health
application that respects our privacy, both from our desktops and from
our libre phones (such as the PinePhone). MyGNUHealth is more than a
health and activity tracker, since it incorporates state-of-the-art
technology and resources from medicine, genomics and
bioinformatics. Thanks to the integration with the GNU Federation, we
can communicate and share the information we wish with our health
professionals in real-time.


See this
announcement for more information.</span>

 The Google for Startups Accelerator: Women Founders program is now open for applications until July 19.
Last year, we launched the inaugural Google for Startups Accelerator: Women Founders program in North America to help women-led startups identify and solve technical challenges while scaling their companies. The inaugural cohort also received tailored programming to address some of the longstanding barriers that women founders face.  
Women founders remain underrepresented in the tech startup ecosystem because they often lack access to the resources needed to start, build, and grow their businesses. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated these structural barriers by disproportionately impacting women in the workforce—and research shows women were more vulnerable to the economic effects of COVID-19 because of existing gender disparities.    
For women founders, access to capital is one of the major challenges to launching their business.  A recent report showed women-led startups received a mere 2.3% of global venture capitalist funding in 2020, falling from 2.8% the year before.  
The Google for Startups Accelerator: Women Founders program aims to help bridge the gap and create opportunities for women founders to succeed.  Beyond mentorship and technical project support, the accelerator also includes deep dives and workshops focused on product design, customer acquisition, and leadership development for founders. Participants will also hear from a roster of speakers and facilitators who deliver both technical and nontechnical programming for women-led startups.  
Applications for the second Google for Startups Accelerator: Women Founders program are now open until July 19, for North American applicants. Approximately 10-12 startups with at least one woman founder will be selected from across North America. The accelerator runs from September through to December 2021.

 Helping users modernize their serverless apps
  
Earlier this year, the Google Cloud team introduced a series of codelabs (free, online, self-paced, hands-on tutorials) designed for technical practitioners modernizing their serverless applications. Today, we&#x27;re excited to announce companion videos, forming a set of &quot;learning modules&quot; made up of these videos and their corresponding codelab tutorials. Modernizing your applications allows you to access continuing product innovation and experience a more open Google Cloud. The initial content is designed with App Engine developers in mind, our earliest users, to help you take advantage of the latest features in Google Cloud.

                    <span>There is an ongoing effort to &quot;modernize&quot; the kernel-development process;
so far, the focus has been on providing better
tools that can streamline the usual email-based workflow.  But that
&quot;email-based&quot; part has proven to be problematic for some potential
contributors, especially those who might want to simply submit a small bug
fix and are not interested in getting set up with that workflow.  The
project-hosting &quot;forge&quot; sites, like GitHub and GitLab, provide a nearly
frictionless path for these kinds of one-off contributions, but they do
not mesh well—at all, really—with most of mainline kernel development.
There is some ongoing work that may change all of that, however.</span>

kernel project&#x27;s release-signing and key-management practices was done; the
report from this work has now been published.  &quot;This review
resulted in seven recommendations that can help improve the robustness of
the security and use of the signing keys for the Linux
Kernel. Additionally, Trail of Bits suggested that more comprehensive and
up to date documentation on the current procedures and policies are needed
to help organizations around the world to best understand the current
stratagem.&quot;  See the

                    <span>For those wanting lots of grungy details about how the PipeWire system
works, this
blog entry from Patrick Louis should be of interest.
&quot;The session manager is the piece of software that is responsible for the policy: to find and configure devices, attach them appropriately to the graph, set and restore their properties if needed, route streams to the right device, set their volume, and more.
It can create it’s own objects in the PipeWire graph related to session management such as endpoints and links between them, a sort of abstraction on top of PipeWire nodes.

There are currently two implementations of the session manager:
pipewire-media session and WirePlumber.&quot;</span>

Google Pay plugin for Magento 2
Update June 15, 2021:  The Google Pay extension v1.1.1 for Magento now supports the Cybersource payment gateway allowing merchants who prefer Cybersource to easily integrate Google Pay into their checkout flow.
 Other key updates include support for Magento 2.4 as well as Magento 2.3. Easy to download and install without any coding, Google Pay for Magento provides fast, frictionless checkout and allows consumers to use already-stored payment credentials. This reduces data entry errors and translates to higher conversion rates and larger average order size for merchants.
 We are pleased to announce the launch of the official Google Pay plugin for Magento 2. The Google Pay plugin can help increase conversions by enablin…</span>

                    <span>The kernel-development community has long had a tense relationship with
companies that create and ship proprietary loadable kernel modules.  In the
view of many developers, such modules are a violation of the GPL and should
simply be disallowed.  That has never happened, though; instead, the
community has pursued a policy of legal ambiguity and technical
inconvenience to discourage proprietary modules.  A
&quot;technical-inconvenience&quot; patch that was merged nearly one year ago has
begun to show up in stable kernel releases, leading at least one
developer to complain that things have gone a little too far.</span>

                    <span>Last week, two entrepreneurs in Atlanta launched Barnacle, a package-tracking business built on the Helium Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN). I was excited to hear this because I’m always on the lookout for use cases for LPWANs and because I host a Helium hotspot and want to provide an essential (or at least useful) service. The […]

                    <span>When searching for examples of HTTP basic authentication with Go, every result I could find unfortunately contained code which is either out-of-date (i.e. doesn&#x27;t use the r.BasicAuth() functionality that was introduced in Go 1.4) or is vulnerable to timing attacks.
So in this post I&#x27;d like to quickly discuss how to implement basic authentication correctly in your Go applications.
We&#x27;ll start with a bit of background information, but if you&#x27;re not interested in that you can skip straight to the code.
What is basic authentication? When should I use it?
As a developer, you&#x27;re probably already familiar with the prompt that web browsers show when you visit a URL that&#x27;s protected by basic authentication.

When you input a username and password into this prompt, the web browser will send a HTTP r…</span>

                    <span>One of my favorite things about the recent Go 1.16 release is a small — but very welcome — addition to the flag package: the flag.Func() function. This makes it much easier to define and use custom command-line flags in your application.
For example, if you want to parse a flag like --pause&#x3D;10s directly into a time.Duration type,  or parse --urls&#x3D;&quot;http://example.com http://example.org&quot; directly into a []string slice, then previously you had two options. You could either create a custom type to implement the flag.Value interface, or use a third-party package like pflag.
But now the flag.Func() function gives you a simple and lightweight alternative. In this short post we&#x27;re going to take a look at a few examples of how you can use it in your own code.

observed, &quot;the rocket science of CS&quot;.  Understanding
memory ordering is increasingly necessary to write scalable code, so kernel
developers often find themselves having to become rocket scientists.  The

especially tricky sort of rocket.  A recent discussion about how to force
control dependencies to be observed shows the sorts of difficulties that

Developing your own custom Google Chat bot is a great way for users and teams to interact with your solutions and services both directly and within context as they collaborate in Chat. More specifically, Chat bots can be used in group conversations to streamline workflows, assist with activities in the context of discussions, and provide information and notifications in real time. Chat bots can also be used in direct messages, offering a new way to optimize workflows and personal productivity, such as managing project tasks or reporting time activity. Because use cases for bots are varied,  you can consistently reach a growing audience of Chat users over time, directly where they work and uh-hum, chat.

This is a beta preview of Python 3.10
Python 3.10 is still in development. 3.10.0b3 is the third of four planned beta release previews. Beta release previews are intended to give the wider community the opportunity to test new features and bug fixes and to prepare their projects to support the new feature release.

                    <span>Kernel development is not for people who lack persistence; changes can take
a number of revisions and a lot of time to make it into a mainline
release.  Even so, the story of the Landlock security module, developed by
Mickaël Salaün, seems like an extreme case; this code was merged for 5.13 after
more than five years of development and 34 versions of the patch set.
This sandboxing mechanism has evolved considerably since LWN covered version 3 of the patch set in
2016, so a look at what Landlock has become is warranted.</span>

                    <span>The Prossimo project has announced
that it has contracted with Miguel Ojeda to work on Rust in the Linux kernel
for the next year.  Prossimo is a new name for the memory-safety
projects being run by the Internet Security Research
Group (ISRG), which is the organization behind the Let&#x27;s Encrypt certificate authority
(CA) project.  Google provided the funds to enable Ojeda to work full-time
on the project starting back in April.


The Linux kernel is at the heart of the modern Internet, from
servers to client devices. It’s on the front line for processing network
data and other forms of input. As such, vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel
can have a wide-ranging impact, putting security and privacy for people,
organizations, and devices at risk. Since it’s written largely in the C
language, which is not memory-safe, memory safety vulnerabilities such as
buffer overflows and use-after-frees are a constant concern. By making it
possible to write parts of the Linux kernel in Rust, which is memory-safe,
we can entirely eliminate memory safety vulnerabilities from certain
components, such as drivers.


We have previously covered another
Prossimo project, which provides funding for
Rustls development, as well as Ojeda&#x27;s work
on Rust in the kernel.</span>

supply-chain attacks is something that concerns many in our
communities—and beyond.  Linux distributions provide a supply chain that
obviously needs to be protected against attackers injecting malicious code
into the update stream.  This problem recently came up on the Fedora devel
mailing list, which led to a discussion covering a few different topics.
For the most part, Fedora users are protected against such attacks, which
is not to say there is nothing more to be done, of course.</span>

                    <span>Climate change, COVID, and the need for smarter, more productive buildings has prompted elevator (and escalator) maker Otis to redesign the elevator. This week, the company launched what it calls its Gen3 elevator platform, which lets architects and/or building managers add smarts, voice interaction, gesture control, and predictive routing to their elevators. Some of the […]

                    <span>We know many ways to detect performance problems, such as extremely low speed and high memory consumption. Usually tests, developers, or testers detect such applications&#x27; drawbacks. In the worst case, users find weaknesses and report back. Alas, detecting defects is only the first step. Next, we should localize the problem. Otherwise, we won&#x27;t solve it. Here comes a question - how to find weak points that lead to excessive memory consumption and slow down in a large project? Are there such at all? Maybe it&#x27;s not about the application? So now you&#x27;re reading a story how PVS-Studio C# developers encountered a similar problem and managed to solve it.</span>

 A little over 10 years ago, we launched the IT Residency Program (ITRP) at Google with a twofold mission: to provide exceptional tech support for Googlers and to empower the next generation of IT pioneers.  
ITRP’s founding principle is learning and development. In addition to formal on-the-job IT support training, the program takes its residents through a focused career development path, including a hands-on rotation in a specific Google function in their chosen specialty. For their part, the residents, who come from a wide spectrum of often non-traditional backgrounds, bring with them a passion for learning. ITRP converts that passion into real-world experience and equips them for a lifelong career in tech.
