                              <span>On June 25, Matthew Wilcox posted

a second version of a patch set
introducing a new
data structure called rosebush, which
&quot;is a resizing, scalable, cache-aware, RCU optimised hash
table.&quot; The kernel already has generic hash tables, though, including
rhashtable. Wilcox believes that the design of
rhashtable is not the best choice for performance, and has written rosebush as
an alternative for use in the

directory-entry cache (dcache) — the filesystem cache used to speed up
file-name lookup.</span>

on July 14 after a nine-week development cycle.  This time around,
13,312 non-merge changesets were pulled into the mainline repository — the
lowest changeset count since 5.17 in early 2022.  Longstanding tradition
says that it is time for LWN to gather some statistics on where the new

                              <span>A while ago I already looked into Avast Secure Browser. Back then it didn’t end well for Avast: I found critical vulnerabilities allowing arbitrary websites to infect user’s computer. Worse yet: much of it was due to neglect of secure coding practices, existing security mechanisms were disabled for no good reason. I didn’t finish that investigation because I discovered that the browser was essentially spyware, collecting your browsing history and selling it via Avast’s Jumpshot subsidiary.
But that was almost five years ago. After an initial phase of denial, Avast decided to apologize and to wind down Jumpshot. It was certainly a mere coincidence that Avast was subsequently sold to NortonLifeLock, called Gen Digital today. Yes, Avast is truly reformed and paying for their crimes in Europe …</span>

In the preceding articles (Creating a VMDK using image mode for RHEL and Integrating an image mode for RHEL produced VMDK into vSphere), we described the process for producing a VMDK file with image mode for RHEL, publishing the resulting file to a VMware vSphere environment, and creating a new Virtual Machine using the VMDK as the primary disk drive for the machine.

Following the open source model of Red Hat, those extensions for Ansible have both a community version and a productized version. To help users better understand the philosophy behind this approach, this article explains in detail the differences between each option and how they can be used.
Many, if not all, Red Hat products have origins in open source or free software communities and are developed by both contributors of the project and employees of the company. A few famous examples include Red Hat Enterprise Lin…</span>

                              <span>Change can be hard. This is especially true when applying a new set of technologies or approaches. Fortunately, image mode for RHEL takes many of the benefits that are found in container technologies, including a simplified build process and portability across a variety of environments, and applies them to traditional Virtual Machine workflows. In the prior post, Creating a VMDK using image mode for RHEL, a VMDK-formatted disk image was produced as an output from a bootc image.  
While the VMDK format is open source, they are traditionally used within the VMware family of solutions, such as VMware Workstation and VMware vSphere. In this post, we will describe how the previously created VMDK disk can be used as the basis for a virtual machine hosted in a VMware vSphere environment.

                              <span>Image mode for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) combines the benefits and methodologies of container technologies with the ability to operate within traditional virtual machine environments. By enabling a familiar container image assembly process that supports several popular output types, end users have the flexibility to choose where and how they want to operate.
One of the supported output formats is a Virtual Machine Disk (VMDK), which is commonly used within VMware’s supported virtualization platforms, like vSphere, but support is also available elsewhere, including VirtualBox. Bridging the gap between traditional operating environments and cloud-native technologies is one of the benefits that image mode provides.

                              <span>Linus has
released
the 6.10 kernel.


	So the final week was perhaps not quite as quiet as the preceding
	ones, which I don&#x27;t love - but it also wasn&#x27;t noisy enough to
	warrant an extra rc.



Changes in 6.10 include
the removal of support for some ancient Alpha CPUs,
shadow-stack support for the x32 sub-architecture,
Rust-language support on RISC-V systems,
support for some Windows NT synchronization
primitives (though it is marked &quot;broken&quot; in 6.10),
the mseal() system call,
fsverity
support in the FUSE filesystem subsystem,
ioctl() support in the Landlock security
module,
the memory-allocation profiling subsystem,
and more.

In this post, I’ll walk you through some of the most common filesystem operations using the powerful features introduced in C++17, as well as some new enhancements in C++20/23. Whether you’re creating directories, copying files, or managing permissions, these examples will help you understand and efficiently utilize the std::filesystem library.
Let’s start.



     
    



1. Creating Directories 
  




     
    


Creating directories is a basic yet essential operation. The std::filesystem library makes this straightforward with the create_directory function.

int main() {

                              <span>The GNOME Foundation has announced
that executive director Holly Million is stepping down at the end of
July, and will be replaced by Richard Littauer as interim executive
director:
On behalf of the whole GNOME community, the Board of Directors
would like to give our utmost thanks to Holly for her achievements
during the past 10 months, including drafting a bold five-year
strategic plan for the Foundation, securing two important fiscal
sponsorship agreements with GIMP and Black Python Devs, writing our
first funding proposal that will now enable the Foundation to apply
for more grants, vastly improving our financial operations, and
implementing a break-even budget to preserve our financial
reserves.
The Foundation&#x27;s Interim Executive Director, Richard Littauer,
brings years of open source leadership as part of his work as an
organizer of SustainOSS and CURIOSS, as a sustainability coordinator
at the Open Source Initiative, and as a community development manager
at Open Source Collective, and through open source contributions to
many projects, such as Node.js and IPFS. The Board appointed Richard
in June and is confident in his ability to guide the Foundation during
this transitional period.


Million says she is leaving to pursue a PhD in psychology. The
board plans to announce its search plan for a permanent executive
directory after GUADEC, which takes
place July 19 through 24.</span>

                              <span>As of June 2024, Active Directory Utility for SQL Server (ADUTIL) is now officially supported with RHEL 9. The adutil tool is a command-line interface (CLI) utility for configuring and managing Windows Active Directory domains for SQL Server on Linux and containers, without switching between Windows and Linux machines to manage Active Directory. This tool was developed to ensure that users get the most out of authentication, user management, and keytab configuration in a more integrated setting.
Does this all sound good to you? Let&#x27;s dive in and find out how exactly we can set up adutil on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9.

You will need to join your host machine to the domain as a prerequisite—see Join SQL Server on Linux to Active Directory on how to get this all…</span>

                              <span>Collecting troubleshooting data, like creating a heap dump, can considerably impact the performance of an application, particularly critical ones. Creating a heap dump on production can (and most of the time will) directly impact the Java Virtual Machine&#x27;s (JVM) performance for a few seconds of applications deployed. 
To reduce the overhead of usage (i.e., overhead on data capture), one alternative is to use a lower overhead capturing framework such as Java Flight Recording (JFR) data. This data can be later analyzed offline and used to track down memory usage, high CPU utilization, and thread inspection, for example. But it can be even more useful depending on the events it records. 
For Red Hat OpenShift deployments, you can collect data via the Red Hat build of Cryostat Operator, which …</span>

                              <span>Across the years spent writing firmware I have come across
techniques that have helped me with reliability, meeting delivery deadlines,
and overall &quot;debug quality of life&quot;.
In this article I want to focus on developments practices and lifehacks
that apply uniquely to firmware 
and avoid the ones that apply to &quot;big&quot; desktop or server software.
This article will be updated as more ideas become crystallized
so please add my blog to your RSS reader. 🙂</span>

disagreements that led to Eelco Dolstra

stepping down from the NixOS
Foundation board, there have been a number of projects forked from or inspired
by

Nix that have stepped up to compete with it. Two months on, some of these
projects are now well-established enough to look at what they have to offer and
how they compare to each other. Overall, users have a number of good options to
choose from, whether they&#x27;re seeking a compatible replacement for Nix (the
configuration language and package manager) or NixOS (the Linux distribution),

USENIX paper by Hongyu Li et al. is not entirely clear, but it does
show that the Rust-for-Linux project is gaining wider attention.


	Despite more novice developers being attracted by Rust to the
	kernel community, we have found their commits are mainly for
	constructing Rust-relevant toolchains as well as Rust crates alone;
	they do not, however, take part in kernel code development. By
	contrast, 5 out of 6 investigated drivers (as seen in Table 5) are
	mainly contributed by authors from the Linux community. This
	implies a disconnection be- tween the young and the seasoned
	developers, and that the bar of kernel programming is not lowered
	by Rust language.

The fundamentals discussed here can be used to set up replication across VMs in geographically distinct OpenShift clusters. This configuration offers robust disaster recovery for business critical databases. See Figure 1.

                              <span>Doug Brown documents
the long journey to fixing a bug in the GDebi utility for
installing Debian packages. He first encountered the bug in
Ubuntu MATE 18.04: &quot;at the time I just ignored this
issue. I didn&#x27;t want to deal with it. I went off to the trusty Linux
terminal and installed Chrome that way instead&quot;.
Two and a half years ago, I committed to doing more open-source
contributions in my free time and was finally irritated enough about
this problem to look into it. I searched around for more info. Lo and
behold, lots
of people
were also
affected and there was already an
issue from 2019 on Ubuntu&#x27;s bug tracker about it.
[...] As is commonly the case in software development, the difficult part of
this fix had nothing to do with the code itself. All of my effort was
spent figuring out Ubuntu&#x27;s patch submission processes and advocating
for my merge request. Nobody else seemed to be interested in doing the
work to actually fix this bug that has been plaguing Ubuntu MATE and
Xubuntu, not to mention some Debian users, for over 6 years. After
dealing with the long process of getting my merge request approved, I
think I&#x27;m starting to understand why!


Brown notes that the fix is
now packaged for the upcoming Ubuntu 24.10 release, and should be
backported to 22.04 and 24.04 eventually.</span>

                              <span>Fedora Atomic Desktop
and Fedora IoT systems installed
before Fedora 40 may fail to boot after an update if secure boot
is enabled. Fedora Magazine has a
post by Timothée Ravier about the problem, how users can work
around it, and what the project is doing to avoid the similar problems
in the future:
On Fedora Atomic Desktops and Fedora IoT systems, the components
that are part of the boot chain (Shim, GRUB) are not (yet)
automatically updated alongside the rest of the system. Thus, if you
have installed a Fedora Atomic Desktop or a Fedora IoT system before
Fedora 40, it uses an old versions of the Shim and bootloader binaries
to boot your system.
When Secure Boot is enabled, the EFI firmware loads Shim
first. Shim is signed by the Microsoft Third Party Certificate
Authority so that it can be verified on most hardware out of the
box. The Shim binary includes the Fedora certificates used to verify
binaries signed by Fedora. Then Shim loads GRUB, which in turn loads
the Linux kernel. Both are signed by Fedora.
Until recently, the kernel binaries where signed two times, with an
older key and a newer one. With the 6.9 kernel update, the kernel is
no longer signed with the old key. If GRUB or Shim is old enough and
does not know about the new key, the signature verification fails.</span>

to be used by various Linux tracing tools (e.g. ftrace, perf, uprobes,
etc.); it is meant to be a version of the tracefs filesystem that
dynamically allocates its entries as needed.  The goal is to reduce the memory
required for multiple instances of tracefs, as Steven Rostedt described in
a session at the 2022
Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit.  He returned to the 2024
edition of the summit to talk further about how to make pseudo (or virtual)
filesystems, such as tracefs/eventfs, more like regular Linux filesystems,
where the directory entries (dentries) and inodes are only created (and
cached) as needed.</span>

PSP security protocol (PSP) is a way to transparently encrypt packets by
efficiently offloading encryption and decryption to the network
interface cards (NICs) that Google uses for connections inside its data centers. The
protocol is similar to

IPsec, in that it allows for wrapping arbitrary traffic
in a layer of encryption. The difference is that PSP is encapsulated in UDP, and
designed from the beginning to reduce the amount of state that NICs
have to track in order to send and receive encrypted traffic, allowing for more
simultaneous connections. Jakub Kicinski

wants to add support for the protocol to the Linux kernel.</span>

                              <span>Alexander &quot;Solar Designer&quot; Peslyak has disclosed another OpenSSH
vulnerability that can be exploited for remote code execution, but only
on distributions that have applied a patch to add auditing support.
Specifically, RHEL 9 and derivatives are affected, as are
Fedora 36 and 37 (but not later releases).


	The main difference from CVE-2024-6387 is that the race condition
	and RCE potential are triggered in the privsep child process, which
	runs with reduced privileges compared to the parent server process.
	So immediate impact is lower.  However, there may be differences in
	exploitability of these vulnerabilities in a particular scenario,
	which could make either one of these a more attractive choice for
	an attacker, and if only one of these is fixed or mitigated then
	the other becomes more relevant.</span>

                              <span>On his blog, Behdad Esfahbod has published a lengthy and detailed look at the state of open-source text rendering.  It looks at the libraries available, application support, future directions, and gives a summary analysis of the ecosystem. 


In broad strokes, OpenType added support for color fonts, variable fonts, and the Universal Shaping Engine. The Free &amp; Open Source stack supports all of these advances at the lower level, but application UI support has been slower to arrive. The Open Source text stack also gained enormous market-share when Android and Google Chrome fully embraced it.

Looking forward, there is a Rust migration of the text stack underway, which will unify font compilation and consumption under a safe programming language. Incremental Font Transfer will enable streaming fonts to web browsers. And my proposed Wasm-fonts will enable more expressive fonts.</span>

                              <span>Why deploy SQL Server on Linux using an Ansible playbook? The answer is that automation is a key aspect of modern IT operations, which is why we at Red Hat are delighted to announce that the deployment and configuration of Microsoft SQL Server on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) can be easily automated using Ansible and corresponding RHEL system roles for SQL Server. You can deploy high availability (HA) solutions, including configuring Always On availability groups. Ansible scripts can automate the entire deployment process, reducing manual intervention and minimizing errors.

One department would like metrics retention for a period of 3 months whereas another department requested metrics retention for 6 months.
One department requested remote_writes to an external server for metrics matching one pattern and to a different server for metrics matching another pattern. This group changes their requirements every few weeks.
One department uses a Prometheus exporter to dump all their data to Prometheus for easy viewing in Grafana and is overloading the Prometheus server causing it to use many G-bytes of RAM which results in poor Prometheus query response…</span>

                              <span>At DevConf.cz 2024,
Marta Lewandowska gave a talk to discuss a
new approach for booting Linux systems, &quot;No more boot
loader: Please use the kernel instead&quot;. The talk, available on
YouTube, introduced a new project called nmbl (for &quot;no more bootloader&quot;,
pronounced &quot;nimble&quot;). The idea is to get rid of bootloaders (e.g., 
GNU GRUB) with a
Unified
Kernel Image (UKI) that removes the need for a separate bootloader
altogether. It is early days for nmbl, currently the project is only
being tested for use with virtual machines, but the idea is
compelling. If successful, nmbl could offer security, performance, and
maintenance benefits compared to GRUB and other separate bootloaders.</span>

                              <span>This article introduces a new feature for Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) with hosted control planes that simplifies authentication and authorization workflows through direct integration with your existing OpenID Connect (OIDC) compliant identity providers (IdPs). Now you can seamlessly leverage your corporate identity tokens to access the Red Hat OpenShift and Kubernetes APIs on ROSA with hosted control planes (HCP).
Benefits you&#x27;ll experience:

Unified access control: Bring your existing user and group management policies into ROSA. Manage permissions consistently across your organization with a single, unified approach.

	Things remain calm, although I do suspect that part of it is that

to shake the screws and kick the tires on what should become a new verification
product shortly.
I thought that a good design to check might be my
SDIO project.  It has roughly all the
pieces in place, and so makes sense for an automated testing pipeline.
This weekend, the CI project engineer shared with me:
It’s literally the first time I get to know a good hardware project needs
such many verifications and testings!  There’s even a real SD card
simulation model and RW test…
After reminiscing about this for a bit, I thought it might be worth taking a

more than a year since the finalization of

Even though C++26 is not yet a standard, many of the proposed features are already

Answering these questions becomes increasingly complex as the number of permutations of use rises. There are ongoing efforts to put more rigor around supply chain security, to begin as an industry to answer the average 742% increase in software supply chain attacks over the last 3 years. 
One important aspect of software supply chain security is achieving reproducible builds of dependent software. Reproducible builds are achieved by a set of software development practices that create an independently verifiab…</span>

                              <span>Random numbers, it seems, can never be random enough, and they cannot be
generated quickly enough.  The kernel&#x27;s getrandom()
system call might, after years of discussion, be seen as sufficiently
secure by most users, but it is still a system call.  Linux system calls
are relatively fast, but they are necessarily slower than calling a
function directly.  In an attempt to speed the provision of secure random
data to user space, Jason Donenfeld has put together an
implementation of getrandom() that lives in the virtual dynamic
shared object (vDSO) area.</span>

about how each Go module is its own self-contained &quot;virtual environment&quot; during

the only one that he got to was a followup to last year&#x27;s discussion on mount-operation monitoring.
There is a need for user-space programs to be able to follow mount
operations (e.g. mount and unmount) that happen in the system, especially
for tools like container
managers or systemd.</span>

even if it wasn&#x27;t so contentious; tag2upload promises a
streamlined way for Debian developers using Git to upload packages to

years due to disagreement and a communication breakdown between the team
behind tag2upload and the ftpmasters team. It took the
threat of a General

1,000 emails to finally move forward.</span>

project, which produces operating system images based on Fedora&#x27;s Atomic Desktops,
has issued an announcement
that manual steps are required to continue receiving updates. Jorge
Castro wrote:
If you use Bazzite, Bluefin, Aurora, or any other Universal Blue
image (including our toolboxes) then you need to follow the
instructions in this announcement in order to ensure that your device
is getting updates. We were rotating our cosign keypairs this morning,
which is the method that we use to sign our images.
During this process I made a critical error which has resulted in
forcing you to take manual steps to migrate to our newly signed
images.
This applies to all Universal Blue images released before July 2,
2024. See the full announcement for instructions. LWN covered Bluefin in
December, 2023.</span>

lifespan of updates for his Android phone. Taking matters into his own
hands, he began developing postmarketOS, a Linux distribution for
mobile phones. Eight years later, the core team and
trusted contributors have grown to twenty individuals, while the latest
release, v24.06,
now shows support for over 250 devices. Although postmarketOS isn&#x27;t
usable as a day-to-day phone operating system on all of them, it can also enable repurposing devices into compact servers or kiosk machines.</span>

back at 40 years of the X Window System:


	A major reason for Sun&#x27;s early success was that they in effect
	open-sourced the Network File System. X11 was open source under the
	MIT license. I, and some of the other Sun engineers, understood
	that NeWS could not displace X11 as the Unix standard window system
	without being equally open source. But Sun&#x27;s management looked at
	NeWS and saw superior technology, an extension of the PostScript
	that Adobe was selling, and couldn&#x27;t bring themselves to give it

                              <span>OpenVINO is a toolkit developed by Intel for deploying and optimizing AI models across various hardware platforms. At its core, model serving involves three main components: the model to deploy, an inference runtime and a model server.OpenVINO in this context is the runtime that supports multiple types of model, while OpenVINO Model Server (OVMS) is built ob top of the runtime, designed to streamline the deployment and management of deep learning models in production environments by leveraging these two key components.
Model-serving engines like OVMS facilitate the deployment and management of models, abstracting hardware-specific complexities and enabling seamless integration with existing infrastructure(i.e. providing metrics). Inferencing runtimes are responsible for executing inference…</span>

                              <span>Like many kernel subsystems, the Linux security module (LSM) subsystem
makes extensive use of indirect function calls.  Those calls, however, are
increasingly problematic, and the pressure to remove them has been growing. 
The good news is that there is a patch
series from KP Singh that accomplishes that goal.  Its progress into
the mainline has been slow — this change was first proposed
by Brendan Jackman and Paul Renauld in 2020 — and this work has been caught
up in some wider controversies along the way, but it should be close to
being ready.</span>

Not so long ago, email and SMS messages started to replace phone conversations, and soon after, instant messaging platforms gained popularity over the tools that came before it. Today, there is a big landscape of messaging platforms, and often people feel divided on which one to use to communicate with friends and family.
In the professional field, organizations usually mandate one common communication platform, but often more than one survives, fragmenting work discussions between them.

                              <span>While the end of support for CentOS 7, which happened on June 30, is
significant, it is also worth taking a moment to reflect on the end of
Scientific Linux 7, which has also just occurred.  Scientific Linux
was once a popular RHEL rebuild supported by Fermilab, CERN, DESY, and ETH
Zurich.  Development of Scientific Linux stopped with SL7, with the labs
switching to CentOS thereafter, but the SL7 release was supported through
to the bitter end.  Thanks are due to all who built and supported
Scientific Linux; you provided a useful and stable platform for many years.</span>

                              <span>On May 7, Kees Cook sent

a proposal to the linux-kernel mailing list, asking for the kernel
developers to start
working on a way to mitigate unintentional arithmetic overflow, which has been a
source of many bugs. This is not the first time Cook has made a request along
these lines; he sent a related patch set in
January 2024.
Several core developers objected to the plan for different
reasons. After receiving their feedback,
Cook modified his approach to tackle the problem
in a series of smaller steps.</span>

                              <span>OpenSSH 9.8 has been
released, fixing an ugly vulnerability:


	Successful exploitation has been demonstrated on 32-bit Linux/glibc
	systems with ASLR. Under lab conditions, the attack requires on
	average 6-8 hours of continuous connections up to the maximum the
	server will accept. Exploitation on 64-bit systems is believed to
	be possible but has not been demonstrated at this time. It&#x27;s likely
	that these attacks will be improved upon.

	Exploitation on non-glibc systems is conceivable but has not been
	examined.


There is a
configuration workaround for systems that cannot be updated, though it
has its own problems.  See this Qualys
advisory for more details.</span>

                              <span>In today&#x27;s application landscape, ensuring data availability is crucial. For relational databases like MySQL, replication offers a robust solution to achieve it. This article explores deploying MySQL replication between virtual machines (VMs) leveraging software-defined networking in the Red Hat OpenShift platform. While this post is focused on MySQL within an OpenShift virtual machine, the same principle applies to any database replication within an OpenShift virtual machine. 



  
        



  

Figure 1: OpenShift master and worker nodes are connected via a software-defined network, facilitating replication between VMs.

In this example, we are working with a standard OpenShift cluster with 3 master nodes and 2 or more worker nodes. Since we are replicating between virt…</span>

                              <span>I introduced two new tools to w64devkit, vc++filt and
peports (pronounced like purports), which aid manual symbol
inspection and complement one another. As of this writing, the latter is
not yet in a release, but it’s feature-complete and trivial to build if
you wanted to try it out early. This article explains the motivation and
purpose for each.
vc++filt
Binutils has c++filt, a tool to demangle C++ symbols. Its primary use
case is operating on whole files or streams, passing through anything that
doesn’t look like a mangled C++ symbol, and interpolating human-friendly
names in place of mangled symbols. In, say, Vim I could run the current
buffer through it to translate mangled symbols (:%!c++filt).
Otherwise it’s often composed with other tools in a pipeline.

submitted a joint position to the European Commission (EC), claiming that Apple
has failed to comply with the EU&#x27;s Digital Markets Act (DMA). This is the law
that requires Apple to support alternative application stores on the devices it
makes.



Apple&#x27;s unfair behaviour against Free Software highlights the critical need to
monitor the implementation of the DMA. The FSFE collaborated with F-Droid, the
AppFair project, and other interoperability experts to scrutinize Apple&#x27;s DMA
compliance, and it&#x27;s impact on Free Software. Since then, we coordinated several
expert workshops with stakeholders,

discussed with regulators in FOSDEM, had

official meetings with the EC&#x27;s DMA team, and submitted a

comprehensive position
to the EC detailing several problematic elements in the Apple compliance that
will harm the Free Software.</span>

Redox is an MIT-licensed microkernel and corresponding user space, designed
around concepts taken from

Plan 9. While nowhere near being usable as a

The image-based upgrade can perform both Z and Y stream upgrades, include operator upgrades in the image, and rollback to the previous version manually or automatically upon failure. Image-based upgrade can also directly upgrade OpenShift Container Platform 4.y to 4.y+2, whereas a traditional OpenShift upgrade would require two separate upgrades to achieve the same end result (4.Y to 4.Y+1 to 4.Y+2). 
An image-based upgrade consists of several stages that the Lifecycle Agent will take a cluster through. Those stages are prep, upgrade, rollback, and idle. The prep stage can be completed outside a maintenance window …</span>

a
set of reports from the May
2024 FreeBSD Developer Summit held in Ottawa, Canada. The topics
include FreeBSD Core Team updates, FreeBSD 15 release planning,
Integration with Rust, and OCI
containers on FreeBSD:


Doug Rabson began by providing an overview of the current state of
FreeBSD support for OCI containers, noting that while FreeBSD has long
supported containers through its jail and vnet features, the ecosystem
around OCI containers requires further development. &quot;FreeBSD has been
able to do containers for a long time, but we need to align better
with OCI standards to make our containers more compatible and easier
to use,&quot; Rabson remarked​​.</span>

some Python apps by Apple&#x27;s app stores. That led to Eric Froemling submitting a bug report
against CPython. That, in turn, led to an interesting
discussion among Python developers about how far the project was
willing to go to accommodate app store review processes. Developers
reached a quick consensus, and a solution that may arrive as soon as
Python 3.13.</span>

https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3130b3/
 
This is a beta preview of Python 3.13
Python 3.13 is still in development.  This release, 3.13.0b3, is the third of four beta release previews of 3.13.

Beta release previews are intended to give the wider community the 
opportunity to test new features and bug fixes and to prepare their 
projects to support the new feature release.
We strongly encourage maintainers of third-party Python projects to test with 3.13 during the beta phase and report issues found to the Python bug tracker 
 as soon as possible. While the release is planned to be feature 
complete entering the beta phase, it is possible that features may be 
modified or, in rare cases, deleted up until the start …</span>

                              <span>KServe is a highly scalable and standards-based model inference platform on Kubernetes for scalable AI. Open Data Hub (ODH) now seamlessly incorporates KServe as an integral component within its ecosystem. In earlier iterations, utilizing KServe necessitated the execution of a relatively intricate installation script. However, with the release of Open Data Hub 2.5, significant strides have been made to streamline and alleviate the complexities associated with this process. Users can now experience a more user-friendly and efficient installation procedure, underscoring our commitment to enhancing accessibility and usability within the Open Data Hub framework.

but it&#x27;s also likely that you have multiple tools of the same type
which makes differentiating them in the GUI hard. Which is why they&#x27;re
highlighted now - if you bring the tool into proximity, the matching
image is highlighted to make it easier to know which stylus you&#x27;re
about to configure. Oh, and in the process we added a new SVG for AES
styli too to make the picture look more like the actual physical
tool. The  tag may no longer be cool but at least we can disco
our way through the stylus configuration now.</span>

                              <span>Eric Sandeen led a filesystem-track session at 
the
2024 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit on completing the
conversion of the existing kernel filesystems to use the mount API that was added for the 5.2 kernel in 2019.  That API is
invariably called the &quot;new&quot; API, which it is when compared to the
venerable mount()
system call, but it has been available for five years or so at this point
without really pushing its predecessor aside.  Sandeen wanted to discuss
the status of the conversion process and some other questions surrounding
the new API.</span>

update on what the Rust Types Team has been up to and its near-future
plans.


	There has been a
	lot of work on the next-generation
	trait solver. The initiative posted a
	separate update at the end of last year. While we would have
	liked to stabilize its
	use in coherence a few months ago, this surfaced additional
	small behavior regressions and hangs, causing delays. We are
	working on fixing these issues and intend to merge the
	stabilization PR soon. We are getting close to compiling the
	standard library and the compiler with the new solver enabled
	everywhere, after which will be able to run crater to figure out
	the remaining issues.</span>

From the first versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, to the latest release of Red Hat OpenShift, all our code is open and available to our customers. We work with people across a wide spectrum of open source projects, some overseen by foundations such as the Apache Software Foundation (ASF), Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) and the Eclipse Foundation, and some independently run by their community.

The user is authenticated with Active Directory over Kerberos and has a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) stored locally on the workstation.
The user makes a request from the browser to access the web application.
The web application redirects the browser to Red Hat build of Keycloak.
Red Hat build of Keycloak responds with a 401 HTTP header: WWW-Authenticate: Negotiate

It includes a development kit that can emulate other devices in the lineup (Jetson AGX Orin DK), a simpler development kit for “entry-level” products (Jetson Orin Nano DK), a ton of exciting software libraries, AI models and even more examples of how to use them. It’s truly outstanding and out of the box shows up as a Ubuntu workstation which will feel very familiar.
However, it can be a bit daunting to figure out how to take this workstation experience and turn it into a headless unit that you can ship to customers far away and update remotely.

explores the ramifications of making code immutable and stored in a database,
instead of a set of text files.
Unison supports a greatly simplified model for distributed
programming — one that describes the configuration of and communication between
programs in the same language as the programs themselves. Along the way, it
introduces a new approach to interfacing with programming languages, which is tailored to
its design.</span>

improvements for large collections, addition of more EXIF fields in

areas to an image, while Overlay allows adding new content by
overlaying pixels from the current image or another image. LWN last

configuration and library before upgrading, as they will not be

sad news of the passing of Daniel Bristot de Oliveira at far too young
an age.  He was a strong contributor to the core kernel and associated
realtime infrastructure, and always a joyful presence in person; he will be

                              <span>Nature looks
at a recent paper on the openness of &quot;open-source&quot; language 
models.


	It is not yet clear how many of these models will fit the EU&#x27;s
	definition of open source. Under the act, this would refer to
	models that are released under a &quot;free and open&quot; licence that, for
	example, allows users to modify a model but says nothing about
	access to training data. Refining this definition will probably
	form &quot;a single pressure point that will be targeted by corporate
	lobbies and big companies&quot;, the paper says.</span>

                              <span>eBPF is a low-level technology for running sandboxed kernel programs. Its use in Kubernetes-based applications has grown rapidly due to the revolutionary capabilities it enables, as demonstrated by Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) projects such as Cilium, Datadog, Calico, and Pixie. However, eBPF in Kubernetes also poses a number of new challenges for developers and administrators alike. These challenges include program lifecycle management issues, the widespread use of privileged pods, the lack of eBPF subsystem visibility, and problems with program cooperation.
bpfman is an open source project dedicated to making eBPF easier to secure, manage, and use. The project includes an operator that allows eBPF application developers to package programs via OCI container images and deploy …</span>

                              <span>Changwoo Min has posted an
introduction to writing custom schedulers with sched_ext.


	In a particular situation, when each scheduling policy needs its
	specific action, the core kernel scheduler calls an operation
	defined in struct sched_class. For example, when the core
	kernel scheduler needs to select a task to be scheduled, it calls
	the sched_class.pick_next_task(rq) callback of a concrete
	scheduling policy. When a task becomes runnable, the core kernel
	scheduler calls sched_class.enqueue(rq, p, flags) so the
	concrete scheduling policy enqueues task p to run queue
	rq. When a task&#x27;s runtime state needs to be updated, the
	core kernel scheduler calls sched_class.update_curr(rq).</span>

                              <span>GhostBSD is a
desktop-oriented operating system based on FreeBSD and the MATE Desktop Environment. The
goal of the project is to lower the barrier to entry of using FreeBSD
on a desktop or laptop system, and it largely succeeds at this. While it has a few rough edges
that make it hard to recommend for the average desktop user, it is
a fine choice for users who want a desktop with FreeBSD underpinnings
such as the Z File System (ZFS), and the Ports (source) and Packages (binary) software collections.</span>

29.4 of the Emacs editor has been released.  This is &quot;an emergency
bugfix release&quot; fixing a vulnerability that can cause
the editor to execute arbitrary shell code in Org mode.  Anybody who runs Emacs on
untrusted files — including those using Gnus or one of the Emacs mail modes
— should be looking to update.  For those who cannot update, a pair of
messages from Russ
Allbery and Florian Weimer
investigates how to disable the Org-mode evaluation, a task that is
seemingly more complicated than it should be.</span>

About 25 years ago, I shared an office with a nice guy named Larry who was working on a linear actuator, which was basically just a brushed DC motor connected to a lead screw.
Larry had an easy job in some ways, and a tough job in others.

                              <span>I’ve come across two approaches to video synchronization.  The first, used by
a lot of the Xilinx IP I’ve come across, is to hold the video pipeline in
reset until everything is ready and then release the resets (in the right and
proper order) to get the design started.  If something goes wrong, however,
there’s no room for recovery.  The second approach is the approach I like to
use, which is to build video components that are inherently
“stable”: 1) if they
ever lose synchronization, they will naturally work their way back into
synchronization, and 2) once synchronized they will not get out of sync.
At least that’s the goal.  It’s a great goal, too–when it works.
Today’s story is about what happens when a “robust” video display isn’t.

Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit, Wedson Almeida Filho and
Kent Overstreet led a combined storage and filesystem session on using Rust
for Linux filesystems. Back in December 2023, Almeida had posted
an RFC patch set with
some Rust abstractions for filesystems, which resulted in some disagreement over the approach.  On the
same mid-May day as the session, he posted
a second version of the RFC patches, which he wanted to discuss along with
other Rust-related topics.</span>

13.5 of the privacy-focused Tor browser has been released.


	Regular readers of our release posts will know that for the past
	two years we&#x27;ve been gradually increasing our capacity to not only
	maintain, but bring tangible improvements to Tor Browser for
	Android. In that respect, Tor Browser 13.5 feels like a milestone:
	in addition to the dozens of bug fixes and minor improvements noted
	in the changelog below, this release features major changes to
	Android&#x27;s connection experience in preparation for the future
	addition of Connection Assist, including full access to Settings
	before connecting and a new, permanent home for Tor logs.


The release also features desktop user-interface improvements and enhanced
fingerprinting protection.</span>

environment in which all privileges are granted, but their effect is
contained within the namespace; they have become an important tool for the
implementation of containers.  They have also become a significant source

create for the kernel.  Various attempts have been made to restrict that
attack surface over the years; the latest is user namespace

Poke-a-hole (pahole),
a program that has expanded greatly over the years, but which was relevant to the
BPF track because it produces BPF Type Format (BTF) information from DWARF
debugging information. He covered some small changes to the program, and then

One of the marquee features of Quay.io is free security scanning for any image that we host. This happens automatically as soon as you push an image to Quay.io. Not only does it scan your image at upload time, it also provides an up-to-date view of your vulnerabilities, no matter how long ago you pushed it. There is no need to ask Quay.io to rescan your image—that information is available whenever you request it.

                              <span>Philip Hazel was 51 when he began the Exim message transfer agent (MTA)
project in 1995, which
led to the Perl-Compatible Regular
Expressions (PRCE) project in 1998. At 80,
he&#x27;s maintained PCRE, and its successor PCRE2, for more than 27
years. For those doing the math, that&#x27;s a year longer than LWN has
been in publication. Exim maintenance was handed off around the time
of his retirement in 2007. Now, he is ready to hand off PCRE2 as well,
if a successor can be found.</span>

This release starts a new stable branch of Libgcrypt with full API and

Kivilinna put again a lot of work into speeding up the algorithms for
many commonly used CPUs.  Niibe-san implemented new APIs and algorithms
and also integrated quantum-resistant encryption algorithms.</span>

the 2024
Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit giving
a look into the APIs for capturing stack traces
using BPF, and how the APIs could be made more useful. BPF programs can capture the
current stack trace of a running process, including the portion in the kernel
during execution of a system call, which can be useful for diagnosing
performance problems, among other things. But there are substantial problems with
the existing API.</span>

                              <span>It has been four months since Greg
Kroah-Hartman and MITRE
announced that the Linux kernel project had become its own CVE Numbering
Authority (CNA).  Since then, the Linux CNA Team has developed workflows
and mechanisms to help manage the various tasks associated with this
challenge.  There does however, appear to be a lack of understanding among
community members of the processes and rules the team have been working
within.  The principal aim of this article, written by a member of the
Linux kernel CNA team, is to clarify how the team works and how kernel CVE
numbers are assigned.</span>

                              <span>There are many different factors to consider when using Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation to set up a storage cluster. This article dives into some specifics to consider when building a production-grade resilient scalable deployment of OpenShift Data Foundation. We&#x27;ll need to dig into the following points to design and build out a suitable deployment architecture:

What does the underlying platform environment look like in terms of architecture/topology/design?
What underlying storage is available and how is that presented?
Replication options.

To start, if you&#x27;re new to OpenShift Data Foundation, please see the architecture documentation to get a high level understanding of what the operator provides and is doing. Under the covers, OpenShift Data Foundation uses Rook and Ceph. If you are…</span>

the other is, of course, the removal of the 
global interpreter lock (GIL), which is also an experiment.  Brandt
Bucher is a member of the Faster CPython project, which is
working on making the reference implementation of the language faster via a
variety of techniques.  Last year at PyCon, he gave a talk about the specializing adaptive
interpreter; at PyCon 2024 in Pittsburgh, he described the work he and others have been doing
to add a copy-and-patch JIT compiler to CPython.</span>

Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit, the BPF track
opened with a series of sessions on improving the performance and
flexibility of probes and other performance-monitoring tools, in the kernel and in
user space. Jiri Olsa led two sessions about different aspects of probes:
making the API for BPF programs attached to a probe more flexible, and making
user-space probes more efficient.</span>

                              <span>Version 6.1 of
the Plasma desktop environment has been released.


	Plasma 6 hits its stride with version 6.1. While Plasma 6.0 was all
	about getting the migration to the underlying Qt 6 frameworks
	correct (and what a massive job that was), 6.1 is where developers
	start implementing the features that will take you desktop to a new
	level.


Enhancements include better remote-desktop support, improved customization,
persistent apps, smoother animation under Wayland, and more; see the
changelog for the full list.</span>

Many Red Hat customers will be familiar with Source-to-Image (S2I) as an easy way to build container images from application source code. While S2I is a convenient way to build images on Red Hat OpenShift, Red Hat works to support our customers when using a variety of approaches, and we’ve recently seen an increasing interest in building applications using Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) Buildpacks.

                              <span>LLD is a linker developed by the LLVM project. It is a drop-in replacement for the system linker and aims to consume less resources than them.
LLD provides production-quality support for the following architectures:

AArch64 and ARM
LoongArch
MIPS
PowerPC and PowerPC64
RISC-V
x86-32 and x86-64

Despite this list, there is still one architecture supported by Fedora that was missing: s390x. This absence impacts how Fedora packages are built on s390x, either by prohibiting packages that require LLD or by requiring that the s390x package is linked with a different linker than other architectures. This difference is known to increase the maintenance burden because different linkers can behave differently.
The support for s390x was added to LLD 18.1. In this article, we explore the work involved…</span>

                              <span>The kernel has a lot of code paths that are normally disabled: debugging print
statements, tracepoints, etc. To support these efficiently, there
is a common mechanism called

static keys that provides a way to enable or disable a
code path at run time, with effectively no overhead for disabled
branches. BPF programs have not been able to take advantage of static keys so far,
because they aren&#x27;t compiled into the kernel.
Now, it looks like BPF may be getting support for a similar mechanism —
and the design could also provide one of the components needed to support

jump tables, another missing feature.
Anton Protopovov presented his plans to add static keys to BPF at the 2024
Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit.</span>

                              <span>Software-interrupt handlers (also called &quot;bottom halves&quot;) have a long
history in the Linux kernel; for much of that history, developers have
wished that they could go away.  One of their unfortunate characteristics
is that they can add unexpected latency to the execution of unrelated
processes; this problem is felt especially acutely in the
realtime-preemption community.  The solution adopted there has created
problems of its own, though; in response Sebastian Andrzej Siewior is proposing
a new locking mechanism for realtime builds of the kernel that may have
benefits for non-realtime users as well.</span>

                              <span>In Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) terminology, Red Hat build of Keycloak will be set up as a Resource Federation Server and AD FS as an Account Federation Server. This means that users will reside in Active Directory (AD) on Windows Server, while the protected web app will reside within the realm protected by Red Hat build of Keycloak on Red Hat OpenShift. With this, we want AD FS to authenticate users to give them access to web apps on OpenShift. Hence, when a user with an account in AD tries to access a web app on OpenShift, the user will be redirected to Red Hat build of Keycloak where they can choose to authenticate with AD FS. The user doesn&#x27;t need to have an account in Red Hat build of Keycloak or in OpenShift for this to work.

                              <span>In this blog post, we’ll examine the potentially simple task of getting and displaying file time. Usually, we can depend on some library or OS-specific code to get that file property. Fortunately, since C++20, we have a reliable and simple technique from the std::filesystem and std::chrono components.
Let’s jump in.



     
    


In C++, working with files was usually reserved for OS APIs and third-party libraries. Here are two examples of such an approach:



     
    


In Linux or any POSIX-compliant system, you can use the stat function to get file times.
#include 
#include 
#include 
#include 

int main() {
    const char* file_path &#x3D; &quot;example.txt&quot;;
    std::ofstream(file_path) &lt;&lt; &quot;Hello, World!&quot;;
