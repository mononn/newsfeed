                    <span>Software Freedom Conservancy has announced that it filed suit against TV maker Vizio over &quot;repeated failures to fulfill even the basic requirements of the General Public License (GPL)&quot;.  The organization raised the problems with Vizio in August 2018, but the company stopped responding in January 2020, according to the announcement. 

&quot;We are asking the court to require Vizio to make good on its obligations under copyleft compliance requirements,&quot; says [Software Freedom Conservancy executive director Karen] Sandler. She explains that in past litigation, the plaintiffs have always been copyright holders of the specific GPL code. In this case, Software Freedom Conservancy hopes to demonstrate that it&#x27;s not just the copyright holders, but also the receivers of the licensed code who are entitled to rights.

The lawsuit suit seeks no monetary damages, but instead seeks access to the technical information that the copyleft licenses require Vizio to provide to all customers who purchase its TVs (specifically, the plaintiff is asking for the technical information via &quot;specific performance&quot; rather than &quot;damages&quot;).

                    <span>It&#x27;s common to see people advocate for learning skills that they have or using processes that they use. For example, Steve Yegge has a set of blog posts where he recommends reading compiler books and learning about compilers. His reasoning is basically that, if you understand compilers, you&#x27;ll see compiler problems everywhere and will recognize all of the cases where people are solving a compiler problem without using compiler knowledge. Instead of hacking together some half-baked solution that will never work, you can apply a bit of computer science knowledge to solve the problem in a better way with less effort. That&#x27;s not untrue, but it&#x27;s also not a reason to study compilers in particular because you can say that about many different areas of computer science and math. Queuing theory, c…</span>

&quot;I&#x27;d love to say that it&#x27;s all looking average, but rc6 is actually
bigger than rc5 was, and larger than normal for this time in the
release cycle.

It&#x27;s not _enormously_ larger than normal, and it&#x27;s not the largest rc6
we&#x27;ve had, but it&#x27;s still slightly worrisome.&quot;</span>

                    <span>In legacy code, you can often spot explicit new and delete lurking in various places and waiting to produce pointer-related issues. This blog post shows six patterns to improve that erroneous style and rely on modern techniques, especially unique_ptr and other helper standard types.
unique_ptr.

Basic assumptions
The code presented here will usually contain explicit new and delete, and we’d like to reduce their use and wrap resources (usually for pointers to heap-allocated objects) into RAII.
Most importantly, we’ll try to follow the rule: R.11: Avoid calling new and delete explicitly from the Core C++ Guidelines:
The pointer returned by new should belong to a resource handle (that can call delete). If the pointer returned by new is assigned to a plain/naked pointer, the object can be leak…</span>

This is very different from what I see in my extended social circles, where people commonly say that velocity doesn&#x27;t matter. In online discussions about this, I frequently see people go a step further and assign moral valence to this, saying that it is actually bad to try to increase velocity or be more productive or work hard (see appendix for more examples).
The top reasons I see people say that productivity doesn&#x27;t matter (or is actually bad) fall into one of three buckets:
Working on the right thing is more important than working quickly
Speed at X doesn&#x27;t matter because you don&#x27;t spend much time doing X

                    <span>The name Debian brings to mind a Linux
distribution, but the Debian project is far more than that; it is an
ongoing experiment in democratic project governance.  Debian&#x27;s processes
can result in a lot of public squabbling; one should not lose track,
though, of the fact that those processes have enabled a large community to
maintain and grow a complex distribution for decades without the benefit of
an overseeing corporate overlord.  Processes can be improved, though; a
recent proposal
from Russ Allbery gives an interesting picture of where the pain points
are and what can be made better.</span>

                    <span>The latest release of the Ubuntu Linux distribution is out: Ubuntu 21.10, code named &quot;Impish Indri&quot;.  The release notes fills in all of the details for the new features in this version, but the announcement lists some as well:


Ubuntu Desktop 21.10 makes wayland sessions available while using the 
Nvidia proprietary driver. PulseAudio 15 introduces support for Bluetooth
LDAC and AptX codecs, as well as HFP Bluetooth profiles providing better
audio quality. The recovery key feature at installation time has been
improved, with the recovery key now optional, stronger and editable.
Ubuntu Desktop 21.10 includes GNOME version 40, with a new and
improved Activities Overview design. Workspaces are now arranged
horizontally, and the overview and app grid are accessed vertically.
Each direction has accompanying keyboard shortcuts, touchpad gestures
and mouse actions.

Ubuntu Server 21.10 integrates recent innovations from key open
infrastructure projects like OpenStack Xena, QEMU 6.0, PHP8, libvirt 7.6,
Kubernetes, and Ceph with advanced life-cycle management tools for
multi-cloud and on-prem operations from bare metal, VMWare and
OpenStack, to every major public cloud.</span>

                    <span>Concerns over the performance of programs written in Python are often
overstated — for some use cases, at least.  But there is no getting around
the problem imposed by the infamous global interpreter lock (GIL), which
severely limits the concurrency of multi-threaded Python code.  Various
efforts to remove the GIL have been made
over the years, but none have come anywhere near the point where they would
be considered for inclusion into the CPython interpreter.  Now, though, Sam
Gross has entered
the arena with a proof-of-concept implementation that may solve the
problem for real.</span>

                    <span>The KDE project is celebrating its 25th anniversary with a special release
of the Plasma desktop.


	This time around, Plasma renews its looks and, not only do you get
	a new wallpaper, but also a gust of fresh air from an updated
	theme: Breeze - Blue Ocean. The new Breeze theme makes KDE apps and
	tools not only more attractive, but also easier to use both on the
	desktop and your phone and tablet.

	Of course, looks are not the only you can expect from Plasma 25AE:
	extra speed, increased reliability and new features have also found
	their way into the app launcher, the software manager, the Wayland
	implementation, and most other Plasma tools and utilities.


Lots of details can be found in the
changelog.</span>

Google Workspace Marketplace is proud to announce the availability for developers to display pricing for their applications published in the Google Workspace Marketplace, and the date their application listing was last updated. 
Launched over 11 years ago, Google Workspace Marketplace has been helping developers connect with the more than 3 billion people who use Google Workspace—with a stunning 4.8 billion apps installed to date. That incredible demand is fueling innovation in the ecosystem, and we now have more than 5300 public apps available in the Google Workspace Marketplace, plus thousands more private apps that customers have built for themselves.

                    <span>The syzbot
kernel-fuzzing system finds an enormous number of bugs, but, since many 
of them may seem to be of a relatively low severity, they have a lower priority
when contending for the attention of developers.  A talk
at the recent Linux 
Security Summit North America reported on some research that
dug further into the bugs that syzbot has
found; the results are rather worrisome.  Rather than a pile of
difficult- or impossible-to-exploit bugs, there are numerous, more serious
problems lurking within.</span>

    Announcing the Google Forms API 
    Google is proud to announce the Google Forms API! The Forms API is     currently available in Restricted Beta, with Open Beta expected to follow     in Q4. 

    Launched in 2008, Google Forms enables easy creation and distribution of     forms, surveys, and quizzes. Forms is used for a wide variety of use cases     across business operations, customer management, event planning and     logistics, education, and more. 
    Bringing Automation to Google Forms 
  
    The new Google Forms API provides programmatic access for managing forms     and acting on responses, empowering developers to build powerful     integrations on top of Forms. The API supports two key use cases:

                    <span>There are many barriers to producing software that is reliable and
maintainable over the long term.  One of those is software complexity.  At
the recently concluded 2021 KVM
Forum, Paolo Bonzini
explored
this topic, using QEMU, the open source emulator
and virtualizer, as a case study.  Drawing on his experience as
a maintainer of several QEMU subsystems, he made some concrete
suggestions on how to defend against undesirable complexity.  Bonzini
used QEMU as a running example throughout the talk, hoping to make it
easier for future contributors to modify QEMU.  However, the
lessons he shared are equally applicable to many other projects.</span>

                    <span>A group of researchers at Trinity College in Dublin has released the
results of a study into the data collected by a number of Android
variants.  There are few surprises here, but the picture is still
discouraging.


	We find that the Samsung, Xiaomi, Huawei and Realme Android
	variants all transmit a substantial volume of data to the OS
	developer (i.e. Samsung etc) and to third-party parties that have
	pre-installed system apps (including Google, Microsoft, Heytap,
	LinkedIn, Facebook). LineageOS sends similar volumes of data to
	Google as these proprietary Android variants, but we do not observe
	the LineageOS developers themselves collecting data nor
	pre-installed system apps other than those of Google. Notably,
	/e/OS sends no information to Google or other third parties and
	sends essentially no information to the /e/OS developers.</span>

Summary
  
Google Identity strives to be the best stewards for Google Account users who entrust us to protect their data. At the same time, we want to help our developer community build apps that give users amazing experiences. Together, Google and developers can provide users three important ways to manage sharing their data: 
 
Give users control in deciding who has access to their account data  
Make it easier and safer for users to share their Google Account data with your app when they choose to do so  
Make it clear to users the specific data they are sharing with apps


What we are doing today

In service of that stewardship, today we are announcing an OAuth consent experience that simplifies how users…</span>

                    <span>This week, Arlo launched what I generously think of as its pay-for-customer-service enticement for its smart home camera products. As of Oct. 4, customers without a subscription who’ve had their devices for more than 90 days no longer get phone support. And after one year, they lose access to live chat support. Those non-subscription customers will […]

                    <span>While learning how to use the new C++ Standard, I encountered several intriguing cases with smart pointers. Casting? Array handling? Passing to functions?
Let’s review some common concerns so that we don’t shoot yourself in the foot :)
Some predefines
Let us take a simple Test class with one member field to present further concepts:
struct Test {
   Test() { std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Test::Test\n&quot;; }
   ~Test() { std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Test::~Test destructor\n&quot;; }

   int val_ { 0 };
};


With the above declaration, we’ll be able to see when it was constructed and destructed.
If we need some more advanced reporting, including move semantics, we could also implement move and copy constructors and assignment operators, but it will be good for now. See more in: Moved or Not Moved - That Is the Question! - C++ Sto…</span>

One of the more extraordinary innovations is the Best Warnings display mode.

                    <span>For the time being, the effort to add the folio
concept to the memory-management subsystem appears to be stalled, but appearances can
be deceiving.  The numerous folio discussions have produced a number of
points of consensus, though; one of those is that far too much of the
kernel has to work with page structures to get its job done.  As
an example of how a subsystem might be weaned off of struct page
usage, Matthew Wilcox has split out
the slab allocators in a 62-part patch set.  The result may be
a foreshadowing of changes to come in the memory-management subsystem.</span>

But, as with many Free Open-Source Software ( FOSS ), tools getting it to work natively on a Windows environment involves the odd hoop-jumping exercise; either involving messing around with the likes of Cygwin or Mingw; or using a full Virtual Machine (VM) environment such as VirtualBox or VMware.
However, with the introduction of Windows-Subsystem-for-Linux (WSL) and the much-improved update to WSL2, running Linux centric FOSS [...]

window is the ksmbd
network filesystem server.  Ksmbd implements the SMB protocol
(also known as CIFS, though that name has gone out of favor) that is
heavily used in the Windows world.  The creation of an in-kernel SMB server
is a bit surprising, given that Linux has benefited greatly from the
user-space Samba solution since
shortly after the
beginning.  There are reasons for this move but, in the short term at
least, they risk being overshadowed by a worrisome stream of
security-related problems in ksmbd.</span>

presentation at
Open
Source Summit North America 2021 on a proposal for a different way to
handle the stable tree.   He noted that throughout most of the kernel&#x27;s history,
version numbers did not really mean anything, but that the versioning
scheme suggests that they do, which leads to a disconnect between how the
kernels are seen versus how they are actually maintained.  He proposed
making a &quot;rolling stable&quot; release that 
provides users what they need—timely fixes to their kernel—without forcing
them to choose to switch to a new version number.</span>

                    <span>Those of us developing software don’t need to be told what a big impact it’s had on humanity this century. I’ve long maintained that this places a serious responsibility on our profession. Whether asked to or not, we have a duty to ensure our systems don’t degrade our society. But in the tumult of so many software projects, it can be difficult to step back and understand the implications of our work. In the last few months my colleagues at Thoughtworks have been putting together a catalog of techniques that we can use to address this problem, which they published as the Responsible Tech Playbook.

The playbook is a free PDF download of about 50 slides, the bulk of which is a summary of a dozen tools and methods that teams can use to better understand their responsibilities. Each summary is…</span>

Google Workspace offers a broad set of tools and capabilities that empowers creators and developers of all experience levels to build a wide range of custom productivity solutions. For professional developers looking to integrate their own app experiences into Workspace, the platform enables deep integrations with frameworks like Google Workspace Add-ons and Chat apps, as well as deep access to the full suite of Google Workspace apps via numerous REST APIs. And for citizen developers on the business side or developers looking to build solutions quickly and easily, tools like Apps Script and AppSheet make it simple to customize, extend, and automate workflows directly within Google Workspace.

Source Summit North America 2021 to talk about a project to change the
way the company creates and maintains the kernel it runs in its data
centers on its production
systems. Andrew Delgadillo and Dylan Hatch described the current production
kernel (Prodkernel) and the problems that occur because it is so far from
the mainline.  Project Icebreaker is an effort to change that and to
provide a near-mainline kernel for development and testing within Google;
the talk looked at the project, its risks, its current status, and its plans.</span>

report on its goal of running Linux on Mac M1 hardware.

Earlier this year we saw the absolute lowest level drivers being merged into the kernel. Those are important for bring-up, but to get a usable system we need many more. Over September we’ve seen a lot of action on this front, with many important drivers now in review or even already merged for Linux 5.16. The goal of the Asahi Linux project is to upstream everything into the Linux kernel, so all our drivers are eventually headed for upstream review.</span>

                    <span>Developers working in languages like C or C++ have access to
two competing compilers — GCC and LLVM — either of which can usually get
the job done.  Rust developers, though, are currently limited to the
LLVM-based rustc compiler.  While rustc works well, there
are legitimate reasons for developers to wish for an alternative.  As it
turns out, there are two different ways to compile Rust using GCC under
development, though neither is ready at the moment.  Developers of both
approaches came to the 2021 Linux
Plumbers Conference to present the status of their work.</span>

    router should I use?&quot;. 
It&#x27;s not an easy question to answer, either. There are probably more than 100 different routers
        available, all with different APIs, features, and behaviors. So for this blog post I&#x27;ve evaluated 30 popular
        ones, and created a shortlist of the best options along with a flowchart that you can use to help guide your choice.
    
Note: If you don&#x27;t want to read the discussion, you can skip to the flowchart.
    
Before we start, a few notes on terminology:
By supports method-based routing I mean that the router makes it easy to dispatch a HTTP
        request to different handlers based on the request method (&quot;GET&quot;,
        &quot;POST&quot;, etc).

                    <span>The 5.15-rc4 kernel prepatch is out for
testing.


	One thing standing out in the diffs might be the m68k &#x27;set_fs()&#x27;
	removal - not really a regression fix, but it has been pending for
	a while, and it turned out that the problems attributed to it were
	due to an entirely unrelated m68k signal handling issue. So with
	that fixed, we could get rid of set_fs from another architecture.

set_fs() and its removal.</span>

                    <span>Paul McKenney has started a blog series on Rust for the Linux kernel.  He has posted six of a planned 11 articles, though several are labeled as &quot;under construction&quot;.

This series focuses mostly on use cases and opportunities, rather than on any non-trivial solutions. Please note that I am not in any way attempting to dictate or limit Rust&#x27;s level of ambition. I am instead noting the memory-model consequences of a few potential levels of ambition, ranging from &quot;portions of a few drivers&quot;, &quot;a few drivers&quot;, &quot;some core code&quot; and up to and including &quot;the entire kernel&quot;. Greater levels of ambition will require greater willingness to accommodate a wider variety of LKMM [Linux-kernel memory model] requirements.

[...]
These blog posts will therefore present approaches ranging upwards from trivial workarounds. But be warned that some of the high-quality approaches require profound reworking of compiler backends that have thus far failed to spark joy in the hearts of compiler writers. In addition, Rust enjoys considerable use outside of the Linux kernel, for example, as something into which to rewrite inefficient Python scripts. (A megawatt here, a megawatt there, and pretty soon you are talking about real power consumption!) Therefore, there are probably sharp limits beyond which the core Rust developers are unwilling to go.</span>

아이폰의 메모리를 덤프하고 프로세스 메모리를 분석하는 작업을 수행해보자.


frida 설치(Jailbreaken iOS Device)
탈옥한 아이폰에는 기본적으로 시디아(cydia)가 설치되어 있다. 일종의 앱스토어인데 그 안에서 frida를 검색하여 설치하자.
위의 설치는 탈옥한 아이폰에서 진행한 것이다. 그렇다면 이제 아이폰과 연결할 컴퓨터에서도 frida를 설치해야 연동할 수 있다.
나의 경우 macOS에서 아래의 명령어로 설치했다.
$ pip install --upgrade pip
$ pip install frida
$ pip install frida-tools
이제 mac과 iphone을 USB 방식으로 연결을 한다.
그리고 mac에서 다음의 명령어를 입력하면 현재 수행중인 프로세스 목록을 볼 수 있으며, pid 번호도 보인다.
$ frida-ps -U

                    <span>Posted by Sarah Fullmer, Program Manager
     
The Flutter Meetup Network (FMN) is an international network of Meetup groups united by their enthusiasm for Flutter. The FMN program mission is to foster a thriving worldwide community of Flutter developers by empowering community organizers to educate and inspire local communities with engaging events.
Meetups – and similar developer community groups - are a great resource. As Flutter has grown in popularity over the past few years, over 100 Meetup groups have sprung up organically around the world to celebrate and educate their members about Flutter. The volunteers who run these groups have hosted many awesome events and workshops. 
    
We, in the Flutter team, see and appreciate these amazing communities. 💙 The Flutter Meetup Network (FMN) is now being launched to support these groups officially. Network members will have access to various resources (more details available soon!), making it easier to plan and host Flutter-themed events. 
Meetups have many benefits, aside from networking. When stuck on an issue in your current Flutter project, chances are good that you can find a developer in your local Flutter Meetup who has solved a similar problem. Or, maybe they know the perfect package for your needs. 
We are thrilled to support our amazing and passionate organizers and can’t wait to see what the Flutter Meetup Network does moving forward. 
Join a Meetup near you! https://www.meetup.com/pro/flutter</span>

                    <span>Much of the free-software development world has adopted Git forges (such as
GitHub, GitLab, or sourcehut) with enthusiasm.  The kernel community has
not.  Reasons for that reticence vary, but one that is often heard is that
these forges simply don&#x27;t work well at the scale needed for the kernel
project.  At a
Kernel-Summit session during the 2021 
Linux Plumbers conference, Donald Zickus and Prarit Bhargava sought to
show how Red Hat has put GitLab to good use to support its kernel team.
Not only can these forges work for kernel development, they said, but
moving to a forge can bring a number of advantages.</span>

Today there are over 276 million smart home households globally, and the industry continues to see rapid growth every year. Users have never been more comfortable bringing home new smart home devices — but they also continue to expect more from their devices, and their smart homes. To meet and exceed these expectations,   we want to make sure developers have the tools and support to build their best experience across the Google Home app, Nest, Android, and Assistant.  
That’s why we’re excited to announce the return of the Google Smart Home Developer Summit on October 21, 2021! This year’s event is free to join, fully virtual and will be hosted on our website with broadcast times available for our developer communities in the AMER, EMEA, and APAC regions. 
To kick things off, Michele Turner, Senior Director of Product for Google’s Smart Home Ecosystem, will share our vision for the home and preview upcoming tools and features to build your next devices and apps using Matter and Thread — technologies transforming the industry. This will be followed by a developer keynote to dig deeper into announcements, and a round of technical sessions, workshops, and more, hosted by Google&#x27;s smart home leaders. 
Building the best smart home platform means using trusted technology and intelligence to develop your integrations faster, provide tools to drive your innovation, and allow you new paths to growth. We can’t wait to engage with you and share more about how we can lead and grow the smart home together. 
You can register for the Google Smart Home Developer Summit 2021 here, and follow along with the event using the tag #GoogleHomeSummit on social media. We hope to see you there!</span>

                    <span>Adrian Ratiu writes
on the Collabora blog
about the challenges that face developers trying to build the GNU C
Library with the LLVM compiler.


	Is it worth it to fix glibc (and other projects which support only
	GCC) to build with LLVM? Is it better to just replace them with
	alternatives already supporting LLVM? Is it best to use both GCC
	and LLVM, each for their respective supported projects?

	This post is an exploration starting from these questions but does
	not attempt to give any definite answers. The intent here is to not
	be divisive and controversial, but to raise awareness by describing
	parts of the current status-quo and to encourage collaboration.</span>

                    <span>James Bottomley explains
how the integration of Matrix and BigBlueButton was done for the
just-concluded Linux Plumbers Conference.


	One thing that emerged from our initial disaster with Matrix on the
	first day is that we failed to learn from the experiences of other
	open source conferences (i.e. FOSDEM, which used Matrix and ran
	into the same problems). So, an object of this post is to document
	for posterity what we did and how to repeat it.</span>

                    <span>The term &quot;interrupt&quot; brings to mind a signal that originates in the
hardware and which is handled in the kernel; even software interrupts are a
kernel concept.  But there is, it seems, a use case for enabling user-space
processes to send interrupts directly to each other.  An upcoming Intel
processor generation includes support for this capability; at the 2020 Linux Plumbers Conference,
Sohil Mehta ran a
Kernel-Summit session on how Linux might support that feature.</span>

                    <span>Version 14 of the PostgreSQL relational database manager is out.


PostgreSQL 14 brings a variety of features that help developers and
administrators deploy their data-backed applications. PostgreSQL continues to
add innovations on complex data types, including more convenient access for
JSON and support for noncontiguous ranges of data. This latest release adds
to PostgreSQL&#x27;s trend on improving high performance and distributed
data workloads, with advances in connection concurrency, high-write
workloads, query parallelism and logical replication.

   Developers: it’s time to start marking your calendars, we’re hard at work on a busy slate of summits coming your way in just a few weeks. Here’s a quick rundown of three summits we just announced this week:  
 
Android Dev Summit: October 27-28  
Chrome Dev Summit: November 3  
Firebase Summit: November 10 

Android Dev Summit is back, October 27-28
Directly from the team who builds Android, the Android Dev Summit returns this year on October 27-28. Join us to hear about the latest updates in Android development, centered on this year’s theme: excellent apps, across devices. We have over 30 sessions on a range of technical Android development topics. Plus, we’ve assembled the team that builds Android to get your burning #AskAndroid questions answered live. Interested in learning more? Be sure to sign up for updates through our Android newsletter here. 
Discover, Connect, Inspire at Chrome Dev Summit 2021
The countdown to Chrome Dev Summit 2021 is on — and we can’t wait to share what we have in store. We’ll kick things off on November 3 by sharing the latest product updates in our keynote and hosting a live ask me anything (AMA) with Chrome leaders. You’ll also have the chance to chat live with Googlers and developers around the world, participate in workshops with industry experts, attend interactive learning lounges to consult with engineers in a group setting, and receive personalized support during one-on-one office hours. Everyone can tune into the keynote and AMA, but space is limited for the workshops, office hours, and learning lounges. Request an invite to secure your spot — we’ll see you on November 3! 
And follow the Firebase Twitter channel for more updates on Firebase Summit, which will be coming to you on November 10!</span>

Introduction
 Since its original launch in 2008, many of the core Google App Engine services such as Datastore, Memcache, and Blobstore, have matured to become their own standalone products: for example, Cloud Datastore, Cloud Memorystore, and Cloud Storage, respectively. The same is true for App Engine Task Queues with Cloud Tasks. Today&#x27;s Module 7 episode of Serverless Migration Station reviews how App Engine push tasks work, by adding this feature to an existing App Engine ndb Flask app.

That app is where we left off at the end of Module 1, migrating its web framework from App Engine webapp2 to Flask. The app registers web page visits, creating a Datastore Entity for e…</span>

been finding its way into recent mainline kernel releases; it is intended
to improve security by limiting the BPF programs that can be successfully
loaded into the kernel.  As John Fastabend described in his &quot;Watching
the super powers&quot; session at the 2021 Linux Plumbers Conference,
this new feature has the potential to completely break his tools.  But
rather than just complain, he decided to investigate solutions; the result
is an outline for an auditing mechanism that brings greater flexibility to
the problem of controlling which programs can be run.</span>

내가 컴퓨터공학 학부 2학년을 다니던 2009년 즈음, 전공 2학년 때 배우는 객체지향 프로그래밍 시간에는 C++을 배웠었다. 서점에 갔는데, C/C++ 및 자료구조의 &#x27;열혈 프로그래밍&#x27; 시리즈로 유명한 윤성우님이 JAVA 프로그래밍 책을 출간하셨다. 놀랍게도 제목은 [난 정말 JAVA를 공부한 적이 없다구요]였다(이 책은 현재 &#x27;열혈 Java 프로그래밍&#x27;으로 개정되어 출간되었다). 그 당시 잠시 책을 살펴보긴 했지만, C++과는 코딩 스타일이 너무 다르다는 생각에 우선은 배우기를 보류했던 기억이 난다. 그런데 내가 졸업하고 몇 년 뒤부터는 학부과정 수업이 JAVA로 바뀌었다는 소식을 전해 들었다. 결과적으로 나는 JAVA를 배운 적이 없었다.
학교를 졸업하고 군대에 가서 프로그래밍을 할 일이 많았는데, 물론 대다수의 공공기관은 전자정부 표준프레임워크 사용에 따라 JAVA를 사용할 일이 많았다. 하지만 난 여전히 C/C++을 선호하던 관성을 따르고 싶었기에 꼭 필요한 경우가 아니면 JAVA를 회피했다. 현재의 나는 주로 Python을 사용하고 golang도 배우고 있지만 이상하게도 아직까지 굳이 JAVA를 직접적으로 사용할 일은 극히 드문 상황이다. 어쩌면 내가 의도적으로 피했기 때문은 아닐까 하는 생각도 들었다. 다른 프로그래밍 언어를 알고 있으므로, 남이 작성한 자바 코드를 보고 어느 정도 읽고 이해하고 약간 수정할 줄은 알지만, 굳이 JAVA를 사용하여 프로그램을 만들고 싶은 적은 없었던 것이다.

Introduction

Google Cloud offers three distinct ways of running your code or application in a serverless way, each serving different use cases. Google App Engine, our first Cloud product, was created to give users the ability to deploy source-based web applications or mobile backends directly to the cloud without the need of thinking about servers or scaling. Cloud Functions came later for scenarios where you may not have an entire app, great for one-off utility functions or event-driven microservices. Cloud Run is our latest fully-managed serverless product that gives developers the flexibility of containers along with the convenience of serverless. 
As all are serverless compute platforms, users recognize they share so…</span>

                    <span>A controversy about the handling of the Time Zone Database (tzdb) has
been brewing since May, but has come to a head in recent weeks.  
Changes that were proposed to simplify the main database file have some
consequences in terms of time-zone history and changes to the
representation of some zones.  Those changes have upset a number of users
of the database—to the point where some have called for a fork.  A 
September 25 release of tzdb with some, but not
all, of the changes seems unlikely to resolve the conflict.</span>

competition &quot;Youth Hacking 4 Freedom&quot; (YH4F) for European teenagers
(14-18).  Six winners will receive a cash prize and a trip to Brussels.
There will be an opening event October 10 and registration will remain open
until October 31.

On Monday 1 November 2021, a five-month coding phase starts and the participants focus on coding until March 2022. Participants may bring all their imagination to the competition; they may code any type of software they want, as long as it is Free Software. The software project can be a stand-alone program written from scratch, or you can modify or combine existing programs. Everything is welcome! The participants will have the chance to briefly follow each other’s work and exchange ideas.</span>

Google Developer Group (GDG) chapters are in a unique position to help make an impact during a time where many companies and businesses are trying to shift to a digital first world. Perhaps no one knows this better than GDG NYC Lead, Anna Nerezova. Over the past year, she’s seen firsthand just how powerful the GDG NYC community can be when the right opportunity presents itself. 

GDG NYC levels up their Google Cloud skills

In the past few years, Anna and other GDG NYC organizers have hosted a number of events focused on learning and sharing Cloud technologies with community members, including Cloud Study Jams and in-person workshops on Machine Learning Cloud-Speech-to-Text, Natural Language Processing, and more.

                    <span>The Kernel Maintainers Summit is an invitation-only gathering of top-level
kernel subsystem maintainers; it is concerned mostly with process-oriented
issues that are not easily worked out on the mailing lists.  There was no
maintainers summit in 2020; plans had been made to hold it in an electronic
form, but there turned out to be a lack of things to talk about.  In 2021,
though, a number of interesting topics turned up, so an online gathering
was held on September 24 as part of the Linux Plumbers Conference.

This blog post will show you the core points for working with those handy types.

This was a 30 min drive.  My father would drop us off in the morning and pick us up in the late afternoon.  He spend two hours in his car each Saturday hauling us around.
Thanks Dad!
Tim and I would spend our day &quot;playing&quot; with the floor model of the PDP-8 they had at the office.  The office staff were very accommodating and accepting of our presence, and they helped us out if we needed any fresh rolls of teleprinter paper, or paper tape.
Several years later, at the age of 20, I found myself working at Teradyne Applied Systems in Chicago.  The computer we used there was called an M365; but it was really just an upgraded PDP-8.  We used it to…</span>

compilers is good for both of them.  One place where that competition 
shows up is in the area of security features; if one compiler adds a way to
harden programs, the other is likely to follow suit.  Qing
Zhao&#x27;s session at the 2021
Linux Plumbers Conference told the story of how GCC successfully played
catch-up for two security-related features that were of special interest to

cp has changed how it handles data

     
enables CoW [copy on write] by default (through FICLONE ioctl),
     
uses copy offload where available (through copy_file_range),

                    <span>In my first blog post about C++20 Coroutines I introduced the concepts behind a synchronous or generator style coroutine and developed a template class to support coroutines for any data type.
In this post I’ll add an iterator to the template to support the range-for loop and iterative algorithms. You may want to review that post before reading this one but the following code should act as a reminder about how to write and use a coroutine to read two floating [...]

                    <span>Here&#x27;s a
lengthy missive from Lennart Poettering taking Linux distributors to
task for inadequately protecting systems from physical attacks.


	So, does the scheme so far implemented by generic Linux
	distributions protect us against the latter two scenarios?
	Unfortunately not at all. Because distributions set up disk
	encryption the way they do, and only bind it to a user password, an
	attacker can easily duplicate the disk, and then attempt to brute
	force your password. What&#x27;s worse: since code authentication ends
	at the kernel — and the initrd is not authenticated anymore —,
	backdooring is trivially easy: an attacker can change the initrd
	any way they want, without having to fight any kind of protections.

Yara Elkady, Google Developer Student Club (GDSC) Lead, can trace her passion for tech all the way back to a single moment. She was sitting in computer class when her middle school teacher posed a question to the class: 

“Did you know that you can create apps and games like the ones that you spend so much time on?”

It was a simple question, but it was enough to plant the seed that would define the trajectory of Yara’s career. Following in the footsteps of so many beginners before her, Yara did a Google search to find out more about creating apps. She didn’t realize it at the time, but Yara had just taken her first steps down the path to becoming a developer. 
Knowing that she wanted to pursue tech further, Yara went to c…</span>

                    <span>Over at the Guix-HPC blog, Ludovic Courtès writes about trying to package the PyTorch machine-learning library for the Guix distribution.  Building from source in a user-verifiable manner is part of the philosophy behind Guix, but there were a number of problems that were encountered:

The first surprise when starting packaging PyTorch is that, despite being on PyPI, PyTorch is first and foremost a large C++ code base. It does have a setup.py as commonly found in pure Python packages, but that file delegates the bulk of the work to CMake.

The second surprise is that PyTorch bundles (or &quot;vendors&quot;, as some would say) source code for no less than 41 dependencies, ranging from small Python and C++ helper libraries to large C++ neural network tools. Like other distributions such as Debian, Guix avoids bundling: we would rather have one Guix package for each of these dependencies. The rationale is manifold, but it boils down to keeping things auditable, reducing resource usage, and making security updates practical.</span>

unexpected, opposition and, ultimately, did not land in the mainline for
5.15.  Instead of discussing how to use folios as part

                    <span>Craig Kerstiens highlights
some of the &quot;little things&quot; featured in the upcoming PostgreSQL 14
release.


	And now in PostgreSQL 14 there is this seemingly small update,
	pipeline mode, which, according to the docs, allows applications to
	send a query without having to read the result of the previously
	sent query.  Taking advantage of the pipeline mode, a client will
	wait less for the server, since multiple queries/results can be
	sent/received in a single network transaction.</span>

                    <span>The Google security blog provides
an overview of what is being done to address memory-safety problems in
the Chrome browser.


	In parallel, we’ll be exploring whether we can use a memory safe
	language for parts of Chrome in the future. The leading contender
	is Rust, invented by our friends at Mozilla. This is (largely)
	compile-time safe; that is, the Rust compiler spots mistakes with
	pointers before the code even gets to your device, and thus there’s
	no performance penalty. Yet there are open questions about whether
	we can make C++ and Rust work well enough together. Even if we
	started writing new large components in Rust tomorrow, we’d be
	unlikely to eliminate a significant proportion of security
	vulnerabilities for many years.</span>

 Long gone are the days of looking for documentation, finding a how-to guide, and questioning whether the commands and code samples actually work. 
Google Cloud recently added a Cloud Shell integration within each and every documentation page. 
This new functionality lets you test code in a preprovisioned virtual machine instance while learning about Google Cloud services. Running commands and code from the documentation cuts down on context switching between the documentation and a terminal window to run the commands in a tutorial. 
This gif shows how Google Cloud’s documentation uses Cloud Shell, letting you run commands in a quickstart within your Cloud Shell environment.

                    <span>Middleboxes are,
unfortunately in many ways, a big part of today&#x27;s internet.  While middleboxes
inhabit the same physical niche as routers, they are not aimed at packet forwarding;
instead they are meant to monitor and manipulate the packets that they
see.  The effects of those devices on users of the networks they reign over may be
unfortunate as well, but the rest of the internet is only affected when
trying to communicate with those users—or so it was thought.  Based on some
recently reported research, it turns out that middleboxes can be abused to 
inflict denial-of-service (DoS) attacks elsewhere on the net.</span>

 Google Developers Experts is a global community of developers, engineers and thought leaders who passionately share their technical knowledge with others.  
Becoming a Google Developers Expert is no easy task. First, you need to have strong skills in one of the technical areas - Android, Kotlin, Google Cloud, Machine Learning, Web Technologies, Angular, Firebase, Google Workspace, Flutter or other. You also need to have a track record of sharing your knowledge - be it via conference talks, your personal blog, youtube videos or in some other form. Finally, you need one more thing. The courage to approach an existing Expert or a Google employee and ask them to support your application. 
It’s not easy, but it’s worth it. Joining the Experts community comes…</span>

                    <span>Ben Hoyt has published a critical
overview of the Python 3.10 pattern-matching feature.


	As shown above, there are cases where match really
	shines. But they are few and far between, mostly when handling
	syntax trees and writing parsers. A lot of code does have
	if ... elif chains, but these are often either
	plain switch-on-value, where elif works almost as well, or
	the conditions they’re testing are a more complex combination of
	tests that don’t fit into case patterns (unless you use awkward
	case _ if cond clauses, but that’s strictly worse than
	elif).


(Pattern matching has been covered here as
well).</span>

So I&#x27;ve spent a fair amount of this week trying to sort out all the
odd warnings, and I want to particularly thank Guenter Roeck for his
work on tracking where the build failures due to -Werror come from.

Is it done? No. But on the whole I&#x27;m feeling fairly good about this
all, even if it has meant that I&#x27;ve been looking at some really odd
and grotty code. Who knew I&#x27;d still worry about some odd EISA driver
on alpha, after all these years? A slight change of pace ;)</span>

While many of the sessions were aimed at engineers trying to learn specific skills for product development, the event held a few panels with a larger focus that included elements worth noting. Silicon Labs also made three big news announcements […]
