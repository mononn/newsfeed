                              <span>In a series of posts on his blog, Oscar Benjamin looks at SymPy, which is a Python-based symbolic-mathematics library.  In the first article, he outlines the &quot;big changes for SymPy with particular focus on speed&quot;.  The second covers polynomial handling; subsequent articles will examine other pieces of the puzzle.

I will be writing this in a series of blog posts. This first post will outline the structure of the foundations of a computer algebra system (CAS) like SymPy, describe some problems SymPy currently has and what can be done to address them. Then subsequent posts will focus in more detail on particular components and the work that has been done and what should be done in the future.</span>

                              <span>The work to add support for large anonymous
folios to the kernel has been underway for some time, but this feature
has not yet landed in the mainline.  The author of this work, Ryan Roberts,
has been trying to get a handle on what the remaining obstacles are so he
can address them.  On September 6, an online meeting of
memory-management developers discussed that topic and made some progress;
there is still some work to do, though, before large anonymous folios can
go upstream.</span>

&quot;privacy sandbox&quot; in the Chrome browser:


	If you haven&#x27;t been following this, this feature will track the web
	pages you visit and generate a list of advertising topics that it
	will share with web pages whenever they ask, and it&#x27;s built
	directly into the Chrome browser. It&#x27;s been in the news previously
	as &quot;FLoC&quot; and then the &quot;Topics API,&quot; and despite widespread
	opposition from just about every non-advertiser in the world,
	Google owns Chrome and is one of the world&#x27;s biggest advertising
	companies, so this is being railroaded into the production builds.


For those who use Chrome anyway, there are instructions on how to disable
this functionality.</span>

Packit is mostly used by projects that build RPM packages. We won&#x27;t go through the onboarding process that was already described in a previous article, but we would like to introduce you to new features that were recently promoted into production.
Testing Farm execution
From Packit, you can easily trigger the tests on Testing Farm even without building the RPMs. This is very handy for projects that basically don&#x27;t build RPMs but want to use these two services for verifying the code. As a good example, we can refer to the Strimzi project where users consume container images.
In such cases, the users want to trigger the tests, verify the code and see some outp…</span>

detailed article on plans to add full-disk encryption, with the key
stored in the system&#x27;s trusted platform module (TPM), to the desktop
distribution.


	In order to deliver these benefits, the implementation of
	TPM-backed FDE relies on two main design principles. First, it
	seals the FDE secret key to the full EFI state, including the
	kernel command line. Second, access to the decryption key will only
	be permitted if and when the device boots software that has been
	defined as authorised to access the confidential data.  This is
	when the initrd code will unseal the key in the secure-boot
	protected kernel.efi at boot time.</span>

                              <span>OpenSUSE Leap is a hybrid
distribution; it is based on SUSE&#x27;s enterprise distribution (SLE), which
follows the &quot;slow and stable&quot; approach, but adds a number of newer packages
on top.  Leap is intended to be a desktop-oriented distribution with a stable
and reliable base.  As SUSE transitions away from its traditional
enterprise distribution toward its &quot;Adaptable
Linux Platform&quot; (ALP), though, the stable base upon which openSUSE Leap
is built is going away.  The openSUSE community is currently discussing how
the project should respond.</span>

The git pull command may look harmless, but it is used in ways that often leave a fair amount of mess. I will discuss safer alternatives. This article is for beginner to intermediate Git users looking to extend their skills in using pull requests and merge requests when collaborating on a project.
Alternatives to git pull
This section provides a condensed version of an approach for contributing to a software project without using git pull. I will go into more detail later.
Configure two remotes on your local repository so that you have origin pointing to your fork and upstream pointing to the repository you’re contributing to as follows:
→ git clone forked-repo-url

                              <span>A recent discussion on the Python forum looked at a way to
protect module objects (and users) from mistaken attribute assignment and
deletion. 
There are ways 
to get the same effect today, but the mechanism that would be used causes a
performance penalty for an unrelated, and heavily used, action: attribute
lookup on modules.  Back in 2017, PEP 562 (&quot;Module __getattr__
and __dir__&quot;) set the stage for adding magic methods to module objects; now
a new proposal would extend that idea to add __setattr__() and
__delattr__() to them.</span>

                              <span>The Mozilla Foundation has published a
report on the data-collection and privacy practices of 25 car brands.


	We reviewed 25 car brands in our research and we handed out 25
	&quot;dings&quot; for how those companies collect and use data and personal
	information. That’s right: every car brand we looked at collects
	more personal data than necessary and uses that information for a
	reason other than to operate your vehicle and manage their
	relationship with you. For context, 63% of the mental health apps
	(another product category that stinks at privacy) we reviewed this
	year received this &quot;ding.&quot;


Proof, once again, that running Linux does not automatically make a device
privacy-friendly.</span>

We are thrilled to announce our latest cohort of the Google for Startups Accelerator: Black Founders program as it embarks on its fourth year serving Black founders in the U.S. and Canada.
The 12 companies selected for this year’s cohort reflect the trends of the broader application pool -  startups focused on improving healthcare outcomes,  protecting the environment,  reducing consumer energy consumption, and removing  barriers to financial resources and home ownership (just to name a few). Additionally, these companies are utilizing emerging AI technologies to streamline and simplify customer, consumer, and professional experiences at all levels.

https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3120rc2/
 
This is the second release candidate of Python 3.12.0
This release, 3.12.0rc2, is the last release preview for Python 3.12.
There will be no ABI changes from this point forward
 in the 3.12 series. The intent is for the final release of 3.12.0, 
scheduled for Monday, 2023-10-02, to be identical to this release 
candidate. This is the last chance to find critical problems in Python 3.12.
Call to action
We strongly encourage maintainers of third-party Python projects to 
prepare their projects for 3.12 compatibilities during this phase, and 
where necessary publish Python 3.12 wheels on PyPI to be ready for the 
final release of 3.12.0. Any binary wheels built a…</span>

What are Quarkus extensions?
Quarkus extensions are essentially adapter layers for Java-based libraries or technologies that enhance your application.
However, the scope of Quarkus extensions goes well beyond &quot;just&quot; importing dependent libraries. They can significantly increase the application&#x27;s performance, help developers be more productive while developing their applications, integrate complex dependencies much easier, and simplify the application&#x27;s source code.
Examples of Quarkus extensions include the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) libraries, OpenAPI generators, Kubernetes manifest generators, and Apache …</span>

                              <span>The Linux Vendor Firmware Service (LVFS)
provides a repository where vendors can upload firmware updates that can be
accessed by the fwupd
firmware update daemon on Linux systems.  That mechanism allows users to keep
the hardware components of their systems up to date with the latest firmware
releases, but it has gotten so 
popular that the daily metadata queries are starting to swamp the LVFS
content delivery network (CDN) server.  So Richard Hughes, who developed
fwupd and LVFS, suggested
that it would make sense to start looking at ways to reduce that burden;
the idea was discussed in a recent thread on the Fedora devel mailing list.</span>

To celebrate the 45th anniversary of “SPACE INVADERS,” we collaborated with TAITO, the Japanese developer of the original arcade game, and UNIT9 to launch “SPACE INVADERS: World Defense,” an immersive game that takes advantage of the most advanced location-based AR technology. Players around the world can go outside to explore their local neighborhoods, defend the Earth from virtual Space Invaders that spawn from nearby structures, and score points by taking them down – all with augmented reality. 
The game is powered by our latest ARCore technology - Geospatial API, Streetscape Geometry API, and Geospatial Creator. We’re excited to show you behind the scenes o…</span>

                              <span>In September last year, a breach at LastPass’ parent company GoTo (formerly LogMeIn) culminated in attackers siphoning out all data from their servers. The criticism from the security community has been massive. This was not so much because of the breach itself, such things happen, but because of the many obvious ways in which LastPass made matters worse: taking months to notify users, failing to provide useful mitigation instructions, downplaying the severity of the attack, ignoring technical issues which have been publicized years ago and made the attackers’ job much easier. The list goes on.
Now this has been almost a year ago. LastPass promised to improve, both as far as their communication goes and on the technical side of things. So let’s take a look at whether they managed to delive…</span>

Instead of relying on static inventories that require manual updates when virtual machines (VMs) are launched, terminated, or replaced, dynamic inventories automatically discover and run VMs across any cloud provider. This means that when you delete an old VM and launch a new one, Ansible Automation Platform seamlessly adapts and performs actions on the updated infrastructure without requiring manual intervention.
By harnessing dynamic inventories, the Ansible Automation Platform empowers cloud administrators and DevOps teams to effortlessly manage and orchestrate on-demand cloud resources. This article explores the power of dynamic inventories, focusing on their util…</span>

                              <span>CPPG에 대한 나의 예전 기억
개인정보관리사라는 일명 CPPG 시험이 있다. 
사실 이 시험의 존재는 꽤 오래전부터 알고있었다. 시험접수 사이트에 로그인을 해보니 2015년에 접수를 했다가 취소를 했던 기록이 있다. 기억을 더듬어보니 당시 공군 장교로 병역을 마치고 취업을 준비하던 시기에 정보보안 분야로 진출하려면 뭐라도 하나 이력을 더 만들고 싶어서 (그때 정보보안기사도 땄었고, 디지털포렌식전문가2급도 땄었다).. 마침 그때 BoB과정을 이수하고 있었는데, 옆의 컨설팅 트랙에서는 뭔가 다들 열심히 도전하는 느낌이길래 나도 신청을 했었던 것 같다. 그러나 결과적으로 당시 대학원에 합격하게 되었고 해당 자격증이 필요없어졌다는 생각에(정확히는 공부를 하기가 싫어서) 바로 환불을 했었던 것이다.
이 시험을 바로 환불 결정했던 이유가 무엇일까? 나는 natural born 공돌이이고 지금도 기술 분야를 본업으로 삼고 있는 것은 여전하다. 그런데 이 시험은 쉽게 말해 문과 성향의 지식을 많이 필요로 하고, 정확히는 에 대해 깊은 이해가 필요한 자격증이다. 그래서 그때는 도저히 공부할 엄두가 나지 않았다.


CPPG를 도전하게 된 계기
시간이 흐르면서 간혹 이 자격을 검색해보곤했는데, 그때마다 종종 CPPG가 국가공인 자격으로 전환된다, 안된다, 하는 뜬소문이 많았다. 그래서 어떤 의미에서는 국가공인으로 전환된 이후 시험을 보는게 이득이라는 생각도 있었고, 그래서 그냥저냥 계속 기다렸다. 하지만 국가공인 전환은 되지 않았다. 아직까지도.
그러다 작년에 깨달은 사실이 있는데, ISMS-P 인증심사원 자…</span>

                              <span>For decades now, software projects have relied on messaging APIs to exchange data. In the Java/Java EE ecosystem, this method of asynchronous communication has been standardized by the JMS specification. In many cases, individuals and organizations leverage Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (JBoss EAP) to act as message-oriented middleware (MOM), which facilitates the management of message queues and topics.

Another month, another reason to celebrate trailblazing creators behind some of the most innovative apps and games. From an equestrian training platform in Sweden to a chilled out fishing game in the Republic of Korea, let’s take a look at some of the exciting #WeArePlay stories of founders and their creations.





Ingrid is a big fan of horseback riding and has always loved the social aspect of the sport. But when she wanted to take her passion online, she was surprised to be unable to find sports platforms specifically tailored to equestrians. So, Ingrid and her co-founders, Totta and Erika, took matters into their own hands, pooling their collective experiences in marketing, programming and economics to create Ridely: a platform that ai…</span>

                              <span>A new operator for Istio is now available on Red Hat OpenShift as a developer preview. This new operator, temporarily known as the Sail Operator, will serve as the foundation for Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh 3, which will be released in the upcoming year.
Key features
Key features of the new operator include:
Simplified configuration: The operator utilizes a single custom resource, IstioHelmInstall, to configure the Istio control plane (istiod), using Istio&#x27;s Helm artifact values for customization.
Focused management: The operator solely manages Istio and does not handle complementary projects such as Kiali, Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger, or Elasticsearch. Independent operators will continue to support these integrations.
Upstream Istio: Instead of the Maistra.io distribution, the operator…</span>

                              <span>After years of working on software written in C and C++, I switched to working on a project that is implemented in Go. More developers may find themselves working in the Go ecosystem as more software, such as Red Hat OpenShift and Kubernetes, is implemented in Go. This article discusses the primary language differences between Go and C++, differences in the development environments, and differences in the program-building environment. Examples and code snippets are from the Grafana sources.
Program syntax
Go statements are terminated by a semicolon. Go treats the end of a non-blank line as a semicolon unless it can be determined that the line is incomplete. As a result, go requires the opening brace to be on the same line as the function definition:
 func (s *Server) init() error {

                              <span>For the typical DLL function call you declare the function prototype (via
header file), you inform the link editor (ld, link) that the DLL
exports a symbol with that name (import library), it matches the declared
name with this export, and it becomes an import in your program’s import
table. What happens when two different DLLs export the same symbol? The
link editor will pick the first found. But what if you want to use both
exports? If they have the same name, how could program or link editor
distinguish them? In this article I’ll demonstrate a technique to resolve
this by creating a program which links with and directly uses two
different C runtimes (CRTs) simultaneously.
In PE executable images, an import isn’t just a symbol, but a tuple
of DLL name and symbol. For human display, a tup…</span>

gh-108310: Fixed an issue where instances of ssl.SSLSocket
 were vulnerable to a bypass of the TLS handshake and included 
protections (like certificate verification) and treating sent 
unencrypted data as if it were post-handshake TLS encrypted data. 
Security issue reported as CVE-2023-40217 1 by Aapo Oksman. Patch by Gregory P. Smith.

Upgrading is highly recommended to all users of affected versions.
Python 3.11.5
Get it here: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3115/

This release was held up somewhat by the resolution of this CVE, 
which is why it includes a whopping 328 new commits since 3.11.4 
(compared to 238 commits between 3.10.4 and 3.10.5). Among those, there 
is a fix for CVE-2023-41105 which affected Python 3.11.0 - 3.11.4. See gh-106242 for details.
There are also some fixes for crashes, check out the change log to see all information.
Most importantly, the release notes on the downloads page include a description of the Larmor precession. I understood some of the words there!
Python 3.10.13
Get it here: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31013/

16 commits.
Python 3.9.18
Get it here: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3918/

11 commits.
Python 3.8.18
Get it here: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3818/

9 commits.
Stay safe and upgrade!

                              <span>In an effort to avoid programming by superstition, I did a deep dive
into the Win32 “environment block,” the data structure holding a process’s
environment variables, in order to better understand it. Along the way I
discovered implied and undocumented behaviors. (The environment block
must not to be confused with the Process Environment Block (PEB)
which is different.) Because I cannot possibly retain all the quirky
details in my head for long, I’m writing them down for future reference. I
ran my tests on different Windows versions as far back as Windows XP SP3
in order to fill in gaps where documentation is ambiguous, incomplete, or
wrong. Overall conclusion: Correct, direct manipulation of an environment
block is impossible in the general case due to under-specified and
incorrect docume…</span>

Giving Google Workspace users the ability to set their working location and working hours in Google Calendar was an important step in helping our customers’ employees adapt to a hybrid world. Sending a Chat message asking “Will you be in the office tomorrow?” soon became obsolete as anyone could share where and when they would be working within Calendar. 
To improve the hybrid working experience, many organizations rely on third-party or company-internal tools to enable tasks like hot desk booking or scheduling days in the office. Until recently, there was no way to programmatically synchronize the working location set in Calendar with such tools.

                              <span>Many software teams create services exposed as APIs, designed to be
     consumed by other software and thus without any user-interface. Such
     services are hard to demonstrate, as they effectively just dump pages of
     JSON. A demo front-end is a simple user-interface just used to
     manipulate such an API. Matteo Vaccari describes how and
     why to build one - showing its usefulness both in explaining the
     API&#x27;s capabilities to stakeholders and to help client developers explore
     how to interact with the API.

Today, the Google Identity team is announcing a beta program for developers to test our integration with the Chrome browser’s new FedCM (Federated Credential Management) API. 
Audience
This update is for all Google Identity Services (GIS) web developers who rely on the Chrome browser and use:

One Tap, or 
Auto Sign-In 


Why FedCM 
GIS currently uses third-party cookies to enable users to easily sign up and sign in to websites, making sign-in more secure for users by reducing reliance on passwords. However, as part of the Privacy Sandbox initiative, Chrome is phasing out support for third-party cookies in 2024 to protect user privacy online.
The W3C FedID community group developed the FedCM API as a new privacy-preserving alternative to thir…</span>

                              <span>Here is a new article in the bottlenecks of scaleups series, looking at
     resilience and observability. Startups tend to only address resilience when
     their systems are already down, often taking a very reactive approach. For
     a scaleup, excessive system downtime represents a significant
     bottleneck to the organization, both from the effort expended on
     restoring function and also from the impact of customer dissatisfaction.
     Punit Lad and Carl Nygard explain that to
     move past this, resilience needs to be built into the business objectives,
     which will influence the architecture, design, product management, and even
     governance of business systems.

                              <span>선형대수에서 행렬관련 연산을 할 때 역행렬이 굉장히 중요하게 사용된다.
행렬 A의 역행렬은 A와 곱해서 단위 행렬을 만드는 행렬을 뜻한다. 표기할 때는 A^-1 로 표시한다. 
즉 A^-1 에 A를 곱하면 I 가 된다.


2 by 2 행렬인 경우
한국의 고등학교 교육과정에서 배웠던 행렬은 2 by 2 까지만을 다뤘었다.
위와 같은 2 by 2 행렬이 있을 때, 그 역행렬은 다음과 같이 계산된다.
여기에서 ad-bc 값을 행렬식(determinant) 이라고 부르는데, 수학에서 0으로 나누는 것은 정의되지 않으므로 만약 det 값이 0인 경우는 역행렬이 존재하지 않는다고 판정한다.
이와 같은 근거로, F# 코드를 사용하면 2 by 2 행렬의 역행렬을 다음과 같이 구할 수 있다.
let inverse2x2 (matrix: float list list) : float list list &#x3D;
    let a &#x3D; matrix.[0].[0]
    let b &#x3D; matrix.[0].[1]
    let c &#x3D; matrix.[1].[0]
    let d &#x3D; matrix.[1].[1]

    let det &#x3D; a * d - b * c

    if det &#x3D; 0.0 then
        failwith &quot;The matrix does not have an inverse.&quot;

                              <span>In this post we’ll have a look at new operations added to std::optional in C++23. These operations, inspired by functional programming concepts, offer a more concise and expressive way to work with optional values, reducing boilerplate and improving code readability.
Let’s meet and_then(), transform() and or_else(), new member functions.
if/else and optional C++20 
  




     
    


In C++20 when you work with std::optional you have to rely heavily on conditional checks to ensure safe access to the contained values. This often led to nested if/else code blocks, which could make the code verbose and harder to follow.
Consider the task of fetching a user profile. The profile might be available in a cache, or it might need to be fetched from a server. Once retrieved, we want to extract the …</span>

Back in May we released MediaPipe Solutions, a set of tools for no-code and low-code solutions to common on-device machine learning tasks, for Android, web, and Python. Today we’re happy to announce that the initial version of the iOS SDK, plus an update for the Python SDK to support the Raspberry Pi, are available. These include support for audio classification, face landmark detection, and various natural language processing tasks. Let’s take a look at how you can use these tools for the new platforms.
Object Detection for Raspberry Pi


Aside from setting up your Raspberry Pi hardware with a camera, you can start by installing the MediaPipe dependency, along with OpenCV and NumPy if you don’t have them already.

                              <span>It is fair to say that the DNF package
manager is not the favorite tool of many Fedora users.  It was brought
in as a replacement for Yum but got off to a
rather rocky start;  DNF has
stabilized over the years, though and the complaints have subsided. That can only
mean one thing: it must be time to throw it away and start over from the
beginning.  The replacement, called DNF5, was slated to be a part of the
Fedora 39 release, due in October, but that is not going to happen.</span>

                              <span>In its default configuration, the Linux kernel will allow processes to
allocate more memory than the system can actually provide; this policy
enables better utilization of physical memory and works just fine — most of
the time.  On occasions, though, the kernel may find itself unable to
provide memory that processes may think already belongs to them.  If the
situation gets bad enough, the only solution (short of rebooting) is to
declare a sort of memory bankruptcy and write off some of the kernel&#x27;s
debts by killing one or more processes.  Over the years, a great deal of
effort has gone into heuristics to select the processes that the user is
least likely to miss.  This problem is still clearly not solved to
everybody&#x27;s satisfaction, though, so it was only a matter of time before
somebody introduced a way to select the out-of-memory (OOM) victim using
BPF.</span>

                              <span>At Thoughtworks, we are strong practitioners of Test Driven Development (TDD).
     Naturally this leads to the question of how generative AI can help with
     this technique. Paul Sobocinski writes a brief memo
     explaining how some of our teams have used TDD with GitHub
     Copilot. As ever, co-pilot can&#x27;t be relied on to fly the plane, but
     can suggest some useful ideas for the red and green steps. It isn&#x27;t
     very helpful for the all-important refactoring step.

It’s an unfortunate truth that women founders are massively underrepresented among venture-backed entrepreneurs and VC investors, with companies founded solely by women receiving less than 3% of all venture capital investments.  In response to this, it has become more apparent of the need to invest in women entrepreneurs in alternate ways - such as mentorship guidance and technical support to help grow and scale their business. 
 

Back in 2020, we launched the Google for Startups Accelerator: Women Founders program to bridge the gender gap in the North American startup ecosystem, and provide high-quality mentorship opportunities, technical guidance, support and community for women founders in the region. Since then, t…</span>

                              <span>Flask is a popular web framework for building web applications in Python. It is considered a microframework because it provides only the bare essentials for web development, focusing on simplicity and extensibility. 
Flask is one of the most popular frameworks for developing REST applications in Python. Flask also has a server to do local deployments and test the application, but no one would go with it to production. So we need another server to deploy the application in production, and one option is to use a WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) server like Gunicorn.
In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a Flask application, configure it to Gunicorn, and containerize it.

For instance, when you use GitHub actions free tier, you are limited to agents with 2 cpu and 7 GB of memory and total execution time of 2000 minutes per month. Other CI providers, like Azure Pipelines or Travis CI, have similar limitations. Continuous integration systems are popular, but free tier is not enough for some use cases. Fortunately, there is the Testing Farm for community projects maintained or co-maintained by Red Hat or Fedora/CentOS projects. 
In this article, we will focus on how to use Testing Farm for projects with written and managed tests in different testing frameworks like JUnit.

                              <span>Readers have been pointing us to HashiCorp&#x27;s announcement
that it is moving to its own &quot;Business Source License&quot; for some of its
(formerly) open-source products.  Like other companies (example) that have taken this path, HashiCorp
is removing the freedom to use its products commercially in ways that it
sees as competitive.  This is, in a real sense, an old and tiresome story.

The lessons to be drawn from this change are old as well.  One is to beware
of depending on any platform, free or proprietary, that is controlled by a
single company.  It is a rare company that will not try to take advantage
of that control at some point.

The other is to beware of contributor license agreements.  HashiCorp&#x27;s
agreement used
to read that it existed &quot;to ensure that our projects remain licensed
under Free and Open Source licenses&quot;; the current version doesn&#x27;t say that
anymore.  But both versions give HashiCorp the right to play exactly this
kind of game with any code contributed by outsiders.  Developers who were
contributing to a free-software project will now have their code used in a
rather more proprietary setting.  When a company is given the right to take
somebody else&#x27;s code proprietary, many of them will eventually make use of
that right.</span>

Kernel
Maintainers Summit went out on August 15; one proposed topic has
generated some interesting discussion about security-bug reporting for the
kernel. 
A recent patch
to the kernel&#x27;s documentation about how to report security bugs recommends
avoiding posting to the linux-distros
mailing list because its goals and rules do not mesh well with kernel
security practices.  That led Jiri Kosina to suggest
a discussion on security reporting, especially with regard to Linux
distributions.</span>

                              <span>On August 16, 1993, Ian Murdock announced
a new distribution to the comp.os.linux.development Usenet newsgroup:


	This is just to announce the imminent completion of a brand-new
	Linux release, which I&#x27;m calling the Debian Linux Release. This is
	a release that I have put together basically from scratch; in other
	words, I didn&#x27;t simply make some changes to SLS and call it a new
	release. I was inspired to put together this release after running
	SLS and generally being dissatisfied with much of it, and after
	much altering of SLS I decided that it would be easier to start
	from scratch. The base system is now virtually complete (though I&#x27;m
	still looking around to make sure that I grabbed the most recent
	sources for everything), and I&#x27;d like to get some feedback before I
	add the &quot;fancy&quot; stuff.


After 30 years, Debian is still going strong.</span>

Discrepancies or gaps between teams can result in deployment delays, confusion regarding versions, and a lack of standardization, all of which contribute to reduced productivity and hindered delivery.
Enter GitOps—a more efficient way of performing API management, offering a plethora of advantages that propel developers and API product teams towards unparalleled success. This article delves into the distinctiveness of GitOps, exploring its impact on API management, and why embracing this approach is indispensable for modern development practices.

Operators are Kubernetes extensions that use custom resources to manage applications and their components. Operators follow Kubernetes principles, such as the control loop.
The operator pattern concept lets you extend the cluster&#x27;s behavior without modifying the code of Kubernetes by linking controllers to one or more custom resources. Operators are clients of the Kubernetes API that act as controllers for a custom resource. 
The purpose is to code the knowledge of a human operator who is managing a service or set of services. Human operators who look after specific applications and services have a deep knowledge of how the system ought to behave, how to deploy i…</span>

same process that can be
created using
the C API, have been a part of Python since the previous century
(version 1.5 in 1997), but they are largely unknown and unused.
Eric Snow has been on something of a quest, since 2015 or so, to bring 
better multicore processing to Python by
way of subinterpreters (or &quot;multiple interpreters&quot;).  He has made it part
of the way there, with the 
adoption of a separate global interpreter lock (GIL) for each
subinterpreter, which
was added for Python 3.12.  Back in April, Snow gave a talk (YouTube video) at
PyCon about multiple interpreters, their status, and his plans for the
feature in 
the future.</span>

                              <span>Any business that wants to grow needs to be built on strong and stable
     foundations. While these strategic directions are often familiar to
     technical folks it&#x27;s important that the improvements to engineering align
     with the themes that resonate with the rest of the organization.
     Sarah Taraporewalla illustrates how this appears with two
     strategic directions that consider improvements in efficiency and quality.

This article provides a brief overview of an instrumentation agent, what the Cryostat agent does, reasons to instrument your containerized applications with the Cryostat agent, and finally, an example of how to include the Cryostat agent into a Quarkus application.
What is an agent?
The JDK Instrumentation API allows additional software packages, called agents to be included with or attached to applications as optional modular components. Agents can be specified by the application’s startup command line with the -javaagent flag, or they can dynamically attach to a running application process. In either scenario, the agent can transform the …</span>

Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform is an enterprise automation tool that allows you to define and manage configuration as code. GitLab, on the other hand, provides a robust CI/CD platform for managing code repositories and executing continuous integration and deployment pipelines.
Integrating Ansible Automation Platform into GitLab CI pipelines (as illustrated in Figure 1) enables organizations to automate infrastructure provisioning and configuration management alongside their application deployments. This tutorial will guide you through the process of integrating Ansible Automation Platform in a GitLab CI pipeline.

We’ve met Stefan several times at workshops and conferences and always enjoyed his good company and insightful views. He advocated many of the things that we and our colleagues support - and as well as skillfully explaining these ideas, he also backed them up with concrete experience from his work. We shall really miss his wise contributions online, and regret that we won’t get the chance to chat with him again. We offer our condolences to his family, friends, and colleagues at INNOQ.

                              <span>For those who find the 6.x kernel intimidating, Seiya Nuta has written a look at the 0.01
kernel, which reflects a simpler time.


	By the way, there&#x27;s an interesting comment about the scheduler:


    *  &#x27;schedule()&#x27; is the scheduler function. This is GOOD CODE! There
    * probably won&#x27;t be any reason to change this, as it should work well
    * in all circumstances (ie gives IO-bound processes good response etc).


	Yes it&#x27;s indeed good code. Unfortunately (or fortunately), this
	prophecy is false. Linux became one of most practical and
	performant kernel which has introduced many new scheduling
	improvements and algorithms over the years, like Completely Fair
	Scheduler (CFS).</span>

                              <span>The Linux fast user-space mutex (&quot;futex&quot;) subsystem debuted with the 2.6.0
kernel; it provides a mechanism that can be used to implement user-space
locking.  Since futexes avoid calling into the kernel whenever possible,
they can indeed be fast, especially in the uncontended case.  The API used
to access futexes has never been seen as one of Linux&#x27;s strongest points,
though, so there has long been a desire to improve it.  This patch
series from Peter Zijlstra shows what the future of futexes may look
like.</span>

                              <span>최근 제이펍에서 해킹/보안과 관련한 책들이 자주 출시되고 있다. 
원서 정보는 Corey Ball, &quot;Hacking APIs&quot;, NoStarch, 2022 이다.
한국어판 정보는 다음과 같다.
한선용 옮김, &quot;API 해킹의 모든 것&quot;, 제이펍, 2023
Corey Ball의 &quot;Hacking APIs: Breaking Web Application Programming Interfaces&quot;는 애플리케이션 프로그래밍 인터페이스(APIs)의 보안 측면을 이해하고 탐구할 필요성을 다루는 안내서이다. 초기 개요에서부터 이 책은 REST, SOAP, 그리고 GraphQL과 같은 일반적인 유형의 웹 API들을 다룰 것이라고 소개한다.  
디지털 세상은 웹으로 연결되어 있으므로 이러한 API들에 크게 의존적이다. 따라서 API 사용의 잠재적 취약점을 이해하는 것은 중요하다.  
저자인 Corey Ball은 사이버보안 컨설팅 관리자로서의 10년 이상의 경력을 가지고 있기에 그의 저술의 신빙성이 높다. 이 책이 기술적으로 탄탄할 뿐만 아니라 매력적이고 사려 깊게 제시될 것이라는 기대감이 들었다. 


이 책의 각 단원은 다음과 같은 내용을 포함하고 있다.


PART I: 웹 API 보안이 작동하는 방식
Chapter 0: 보안 테스트 준비: API 보안 테스트에 필요한 준비에 대한 필수 가이드로, 도구, 자원, 초기 고려 사항을 아마도 개요로 설명한다.
Chapter 1: 웹 애플리케이션이 작동하는 방법: 웹 애플리케이션의 기본 구성 요소를 분석하며, 그 구조, 기능, 일반적인 사용 사례를 설명한다.

file-position locking that demonstrated the hazards that can result
from unexpected concurrency.  It turns out that this discussion had not yet
fully run its course.  Since that article was written, additional changes
intended to address a performance regression evolved into a core virtual
filesystem (VFS) layer API change to carry out some much-delayed housecleaning.</span>

The Indian startup ecosystem is thriving, with new startups being founded every day. The country has a large pool of talented engineers and entrepreneurs, and a growing number of investors, policy makers and new age enterprises are looking to back Indian startups.
Google Developer Groups (GDGs) in 50 key Indian cities with varying tech ecosystems across India have seen a healthy mix of developers from the startup ecosystem participating in local meetups. As a result, GDGs have created a platform in collaboration with Google to help early-stage startups accelerate their growth. GDGs across India are increasingly playing a vital role in assisting startup founders and their teams with content, networking opportunities, hackathons, bootcamps, demo days, and more. 
Startup Success Days with the goal of strengthening how developer communities interact with startup founders, VCs, and Googlers to discuss, share, and learn about the latest trends like Generative AI, Google Cloud, Google Maps, and Keras.






  
Startup Success Days will be held in 15 cities across India, starting with 8 cities in August and September: Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Indore, Chennai, New Delhi, Mumbai, and Pune. 
The next event will be hosted at Bangalore on August 12, 2023 at Google Office. The events will be free to attend and will be open to all startups, regardless of stage or industry. The events will cover technical topics, focused on Google technologies, and will provide opportunities for startups to receive mentorship from industry experts, network with other startups, and meet VCs to receive feedback on their business models. 
Learn more and register for Startup Success Days on our website.
We look forward to seeing you there!

At Google, it’s our responsibility to keep users safe online and ensure they’re able to enjoy the products and services they love while knowing their personal information is private and secure. We’re able to do more with less data through the development of our privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) like differential privacy and federated learning.
And throughout the global tech industry, we’re excited to see adoption of PETs is on the rise. The UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) recently published guidance for how organizations including local governments can start using PETs to aid with data minimization and compliance with data protection laws. Consulting firm Gartner predicts that within the n…</span>

has announced its
existence.  It is a collaboration between CIQ (Rocky Linux), Oracle,
and SUSE to provide an RHEL-compatible distribution.


	Starting later this year, OpenELA will provide sources necessary
	for downstreams compatible with RHEL to exist, with initial focus
	on RHEL versions EL8, EL9 and possibly EL7. The project is
	committed to ensuring the continued availability of OpenELA sources
	to the community indefinitely.

	OpenELA’s core tenets, reflecting the spirit of the project,
	include full compliance with this existing standard, swift updates
	and secure fixes, transparency, community, and ensuring the
	resource remains free and redistributable for all.</span>

written to; among other things, this knowledge is needed to determine which
pages can 
be immediately reclaimed or to properly write dirty pages to backing store.
Sometimes, though, user space also needs access to this information in a
reliable and fast manner.  This
patch series from Muhammad Usama Anjum adds a new ioctl() call
for this purpose; using it requires repurposing an existing system call in
an unusual way, though.</span>
