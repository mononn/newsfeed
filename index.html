                              <span>In the recent discussion on commenting at
LWN, several readers asked for the ability to hide subthreads of a long
comment stream.  That feature has just been added; it is also integrated
with the three comment-display modes and with comment filtering, removing
the need for JavaScript for filtering.  Hiding is not persistent; no extra
data is stored at either end.

Give it a try; if you have comments on the new mechanism, this is the place
to put them.</span>

                              <span>The saga of the i_version field for inodes, which tracks the
occurrence of changes
to the data or metadata of a file, continued in a discussion at the 2024 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit.  In a session led by
Jeff Layton, who has been doing a lot the work on changing the semantics and functioning of
i_version over the years, he updated attendees on the status of the effort since a session at last year&#x27;s summit.  His summary
was that things are
&quot;pretty much where we started last year&quot;, but the discussion this time
pointed to some possible ways forward.</span>

                              <span>There are few topics as arcane as memory models, so it was a pleasant surprise
when the double-length session on the BPF memory model at the
Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit turned out to be
understandable. Paul McKenney led the session, although he was clear that the
work he was presenting was also due to Puranjay Mohan, who unfortunately could
not attend the summit.
BPF does not actually have a formalized memory model yet;
instead it has relied on a history of talks like this one and a general informal understanding.
Unfortunately, ignoring memory models does not make them go away, and this has
already caused at least one BPF-related bug on weakly-ordered architectures.
Figuring out what a formal memory model for BPF should define was the focus of
McKenney&#x27;s talk.</span>

                              <span>Debian had a major discussion
about mounting /tmp as a RAM-based tmpfs in 2012 but inertia
won out in the end. Debian systems have continued to
store temporary files on disk by default. Until now. A mere 
12 years later, the project will be switching to a RAM-based /tmp in the Debian
13 (&quot;Trixie&quot;) release. Additionally, starting with Trixie, the
default will be to periodically clean up temporary files automatically in
/tmp and /var/tmp. Naturally, it involved a lengthy discussion first.</span>

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), a non-profit organization fostering open source technologies, plays a crucial role in this evolution. The CNCF acts as a hub, bringing together developers and companies to create and refine technologies specifically designed for building and running applications in the cloud. These &quot;cloud-native&quot; technologies emphasize scalability, resilience, and agility–essential qualities for modern software that needs to adapt to ever-changing demands.
However, the very features that make cloud-native development powerful also introduce layers of complexity. As software development teams leverage a growing ecosystem of services, APIs, and tools, developers can find themselves overwhelmed. Jugglin…</span>

Figure 1 depicts an infrastructure diagram from the perftest-toolkit repository.



  
        



  

Figure 1: Infrastructure diagram showing how the the load testing tooling relates to 3scale API Management and OpenShift.

At first look I was unsure what this gave me or what it required. But after playing around with it for a while, I eventually figured it out along with a few pain points.
What do we need?
Prerequisites:

A Red Hat OpenShift Kubernetes cluster.
An instance of 3scale API Management on this cluster.

on reducing software&#x27;s environmental impact, has announced its Opt
Green campaign to reduce e-waste:
Over the next two years, the &quot;Opt Green&quot; initiative will bring what
KDE Eco has been doing for sustainable software directly to end
users. A particular target group for the project is those whose
consumer behavior is driven by principles related to the environment,
and not just price or convenience: the &quot;eco-consumers&quot;.
Through online and offline campaigns as well as installation
workshops, we will demonstrate the power of Free Software to drive
down resource and energy consumption, and keep devices in use for the
lifespan of the hardware, not the software.
Our motto: The most environmentally-friendly device is the
one you already own.
See the KDE Eco Get
Involved page for more information on how to participate.</span>

                              <span>The &quot;pidfdfs&quot; virtual filesystem was added to the 6.9 kernel release as a
way to export better information about running processes to user space.  It
replaced a previous implementation in a way that was, on its surface, fully
compatible while adding a number of new capabilities.  This transition,
which was intended to be entirely invisible to existing applications,
already ran into trouble in March, when a
misunderstanding with SELinux caused systems with pidfdfs to fail to boot
properly.  That problem was quickly fixed, but it turns out that there was
one more surprise in store, showing just how hard ABI compatibility can be
at times.</span>

application are celebrating
25 years of development with a detailed history of the project.


	A quarter century. That&#x27;s how long we&#x27;ve been working on
	Krita. Well, what would become Krita. It started out as KImageShop,
	but that name was nuked by a now long-dead German lawyer. Then it
	was renamed to Krayon, and that name was also nuked. Then it was
	renamed to Krita, and that name stuck.</span>

                              <span>Managing environments efficiently has become a significant challenge for DevOps engineers, platform engineers, and developers. The concept of Environment as a Service (EaaS) promises agility and scalability but is often challenged with the complexities of provisioning, de-provisioning, applying consistent configurations across namespaces, and managing Day 2 operations. Some of the challenges include ensuring isolation between teams, managing access controls and automating the environment life cycles to support CI/CD (continuous integration/continuous deployment). As organizations strive to streamline these processes, the need for a product that can offer simple, efficient, flexible and expandable solutions is very important.

EA gets a lot of the grief for their employment history.
For anyone considering work at Bioware, beware of them as well.
They use seriously cult like tactics to keep their employees towing the company line, but don&#x27;t be fooled. The second you don&#x27;t tow that line you&#x27;ll be walked out the doors.

eBPF for Windows, but also

uBPF,

others. Some hardware manufacturers are even
considering integrating BPF directly into networking hardware. Dave Thaler

things have not gone so well.  This time is quickly becoming one of those
others.</span>

                              <span>Testing templates for generating HTML leads to tests that are very
        similar. Matteo Vaccari wisely likes to separate the
        common elements of tests from those that vary. He continues
        his article to show how he does this by
        parameterizing the tests. The resulting tests are
        easier to write, and more importantly, faster to understand and modify.

                              <span>Juntao Qiu&#x27;s completes his set of data fetching
      patterns for single-page applications. Prefetching involves fetching data
      before it&#x27;s called for in the application flow. Although this can mean
      data is fetched unnecessarily, it reduces latency should the data be needed.

block-mapping abstraction is being used by more filesystems, in part
because of its support for large folios.  But there are some challenges in
adopting iomap, which was the topic of a discussion led by Ritesh Harjani
in a combined storage and filesystem session at the 2024 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit.  One of the main trouble
spots is how to handle metadata, which is not an area that iomap has been aimed
at.</span>

Argo Rollouts is a Kubernetes controller and set of CRDs that provide advanced deployment capabilities such as blue/green, canary, canary analysis, experimentation, and progressive delivery features to Kubernetes. In this demo, we are going to use canary capabilities. 
You can also check this other article for a blue/green deployment strategy with Argo Rollouts.

                              <span>This article is a quick introduction to Red Hat&#x27;s Shenandoah, a high-performance low-pause-time garbage collector. It covers Shenandoah&#x27;s basic features, use cases, garbage collection (GC) logging, and basic troubleshooting.
This post is meant to be a straightforward overview. For a deeper dive, I recommend going straight to the upstream documentation page. The upstream email list is shenandoah-dev@openjdk.org.
About Shenandoah GC
Here is a very quick summary of Shenandoah&#x27;s key characteristics:

Concurrent: This means the application runs together with the garbage collection.
Location-based GC: Forwarding pointers enable Shenandoah to collect each region independently without remembered sets.
Not generational-based: This means the log does not have Young, Tenure, or Old divisions; Therefo…</span>

that it is time to give up on DNSSEC and look for a better way to secure
the Internet namespace.


	What appears to be very clear (to me at any rate!) is that DNSSEC
	as we know it today is just not going anywhere. It&#x27;s too complex,
	too fragile and just too slow to use for the majority of services
	and their users. Some value its benefits highly enough that they
	are prepared to live with its shortcomings, but that&#x27;s not the case
	for the overall majority of name holders and for the majority of
	users, and no amount of passionate exhortations about DNSSEC will

added to LLVM to make writing BPF programs easier. While there is nothing specific
to LLVM about BPF code (and the next session in the track was led by GCC
developer José Marchesi about better support for that compiler), LLVM is currently the most
common way to turn C code into BPF bytecode. That translation, however, runs
into problems when the BPF verifier cannot understand the code LLVM&#x27;s
optimizations produce.</span>

memory-management subsystem is the replacement of the page
structure, which describes a page of physical memory, with an eight-byte
&quot;memory descriptor&quot;.  This change would reduce the overhead of tracking
physical memory, increase type safety, and make memory management more
flexible.  Thus far, though, details on what the memory-descriptor future
will look like have been relatively scarce.  At the 2024 Linux Storage,

5,000 of those came in after &quot;The first half of

during the 6.1 development cycle; since then, it has taken its
place at the core of the kernel&#x27;s memory-management subsystem.
Unsurprisingly, work on maple trees is not yet done.  Maple-tree maintainer
Liam Howlett ran a session in the memory-management track of the 2024 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory-Management and BPF Summit to discuss the current
state of the maple tree and which features can be expected next.</span>

There are numerous examples of how companies have been very successful by following this approach.
But the world of embedded software is commonly an exception …

This is a summary of the publicly available documents on the 2011-2012 FTC investigation of Google&#x27;s allegedly antitcompetive actions in search and ads, followed by a tech-focused analysis of the decision from someone who&#x27;s worked at the two companies that are discussed in the most detail in the memos (Google and Microsoft), worked in search, and worked closely with ads teams on optimizing ads ranking algorithms. I&#x27;ve seen a number of law-focused and economics-focused analyses, but I haven&#x27;t seen a tech-focused analysis in a level of detail I find satisfying. In particular, a number of key arguments in the memos rely on evidence and inferences that would&#x27;ve seen implausible to so…</span>

                              <span>Using huge pages has been known for years to improve the performance of
many workloads.  But traditional huge pages, often sized by the CPU at 2MB,
can be difficult to allocate and can waste memory due to internal
fragmentation.  Driven by both the folio transition and hardware
improvements, attention to smaller, multi-size transparent huge pages
(mTHPs) has been on the rise.  In two memory-management-track sessions at
the 2024 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory-Management and BPF Summit, developers discussed the
kernel&#x27;s ability to reliably allocate mTHPs and the performance gains that
result.</span>

“concatenate anything to anything” within an arena built atop a core of
9-ish lines of code. The key insight originated from a reader suggestion
about dynamic arrays. The subject of concatenation can be a string,
dynamic array, or even something else. The “system” is extensible, and
especially useful for path handling.
Continuing from last time, the examples are in light, C-style C++.
I chose it because templates and function overloading express the concepts
succinctly. It uses no standard library functionality, so converting to C,
or similar, should be straightforward. The core concatenation “operator”:

T concat(arena *a, T head, T tail)

                              <span>Occasionally we need to compute the size of an object that does not yet
exist, or a subscript that may fall out of bounds. It’s easy to miss
the edge cases where results overflow, creating a nasty, subtle bug, even
in the presence of type safety. Ideally such computations happen in
specialized code, such as inside an allocator (calloc, reallocarray)
and not outside by the allocatee (i.e. malloc). Mitigations exist with
different trade-offs: arbitrary precision, or using a wider fixed integer
— i.e. 128-bit integers on 64-bit hosts. In the typical case, working only
with fixed size-type integers, I’ve come up with a set of guidelines to
avoid overflows in the edge cases.
Range check before computing a result. No exceptions.
Do not cast unless you know a priori the operand is in range.

continuation of a discussion at last year&#x27;s

16KB buffered I/O; it currently has to do a lot of extra work to ensure
that its data is safe on disk.  A promise of non-torn, 16KB buffered writes
would allow the database

few orders of magnitude.  It is generally accepted that using large page

deferred to Fedora 41. The developers have had nearly a year to address
compatibility problems and bring DNF5 to a state suitable to replace DNF4. Signs point to a successful switch in

Graphite blog post retells the history of the BitKeeper fiasco and the
dawn of the Git era.


	When we think of history, we often romanticize it as being born of
	a sudden stroke of inspiration. But the creation of git shows the
	far harsher reality of invention: a slowly escalating disagreement
	over a license; the need for a scrappy backup solution to unblock
	work; and then continued polishing and iteration through years and
	years, led not by the inventor, but rather a community.


For those who weren&#x27;t around in those days, a perusal of the LWN coverage
from the time might be of interest too, including:

                              <span>The interaction of AI/ML and edge computing occurs in a variety of businesses. For example, in the retail industry, customer behavior and patterns can be used to determine promotions. In a manufacturing facility, likewise, data inference can help improve processes where machines are failing, products are not up to standard, and so on. The basic premise is that you might collect data and then infer from it in order to make decisions based on it.
In the context of this retail use case example, a superstore company has branches spread across the country. Each branch decides the products it wants to sell and can customize an AI/ML intelligent app for customers to use.

OpenShift sandboxed containers, based on Kata Containers, and generally available since OpenShift 4.8, is a native Kubernetes CRI runtime that provides an additional layer of isolation for workloads through hardware virtualization.
When used together, hosted control planes and OpenShift sandboxed containers offer several benefits, such as speed, separation of concerns, and the necessary hardening to run multi-tenant workloads with stringent security constraints.

implementation also involves the kernel&#x27;s filesystem and storage layers.
So it is not surprising that a session on the kernel&#x27;s swap abstraction
layer, led by Chris Li at the 2024 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory-Management and BPF Summit, was held jointly by all
three of those tracks.  Li has some ambitious ideas for an improved
subsystem, but getting to a workable implementation may not be easy.</span>

sched_ext, the extensible BPF scheduler that LWN
covered a in early May. In short, sched_ext is intended as a platform for
rapid experimentation with schedulers, and a tool to let performance-minded
administrators customize the scheduler to their workload. The patch set has seen
several revisions, becoming more generic and powerful over time.
Vernet spoke about what has been done in the past year,
and what is still missing before sched_ext can be considered pretty much

                              <span>Almost immediately after the merging of control
groups, kernel developers set their sights on reimplementing them
properly.  The second version of the control-group API started trickling
into the kernel around the 3.16 release in 2014 and users have long since
been encouraged to migrate, but support for (and users of) the initial API
remain.  At the 2024
Linux Storage, Filesystem, Memory-Management and BPF Summit,
memory-management developers discussed whether (and when) it might be
possible to remove the version-1 memory controller.  The session was led by
Shakeel Butt and (participating remotely) Roman Gushchin.</span>

In today’s IT world, downtime, no matter how small, can have a disastrous effect on a business’ ability to compete in the marketplace. 
What is disaster recovery?
There are many options to consider when it comes to the concepts of business continuity and disaster recovery. Primarily we find ourselves concerned with two major metrics: the recovery point objective (RPO) and the recovery time objective (RTO). 
The RPO is what amount of data is considered an acceptable loss in the event of a disaster. If you lose data due to an unforeseen event, and your last successful backup and restore point is three days old, is that an acceptable loss of data?

These include reducing the attack surface, ensuring the images are hardened, and monitoring their compliance on an ongoing basis. We will explore how Red Hat Insights can achieve what no other service can by leveraging Red Hat’s open hybrid cloud strategy. You can use Red Hat Insights image builder to deploy pre-hardened images then monitor the systems with our compliance tool, compared to using custom-built testing frameworks leveraging tools such as AWS Security Hub.
Building images
Insights image builder makes the process of hardening images much simpler because it leverages OpenSCAP remediations at build time before the image has even been launched. This is desirable since some options, such a…</span>

Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit, Luis Chamberlain led a
discussion on filesystem support for block sizes larger than the usual 4KB

session was meant to look at the intersection of larger block sizes
with atomic block writes  that avoid torn
(partial) writes (which was also discussed last year), it mostly focused on the
filesystem side.  Over time, the
block sizes offered by storage devices have risen from the original
512 bytes; Chamberlain
wanted to discuss filesystem support for block sizes larger than 4KB.</span>

Perhaps the more obscure meaning is the memory-management subsystem&#x27;s view
of how physical memory is organized on a given system.  A proper
representation of physical memory will be more efficient in terms of memory
and CPU use.  Since hardware comes in numerous variations, the kernel
supports a number of memory models to match; see this article for details.  At the 2024 Linux Storage,

flags describing how the page is used and various aspects of its current
state.  Space for page flags has been in chronic short supply, leading to a desire to
eliminate or consolidate them whenever possible.  That objective, though,
is hampered by the fact that the purpose of many page flags is not well
understood.  In a memory-management-track session at the 2024 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory-Management and BPF Summit, Matthew Wilcox set out to
cooperatively update the page-flag documentation to improve that situation.</span>

                              <span>The kernel&#x27;s hugetlbfs
subsystem was the first mechanism by which the kernel made huge pages
available to user space; it was added to the 2.5.46 development kernel in
2002.  While hugetlbfs remains useful, it is also viewed as a sort of
second memory-management subsystem that would be best unified with the rest
of the kernel.  At the 2024 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory-Management and BPF Summit, Peter Xu raised the
question of what that unification would involve and what the first steps
might be.</span>

Running Node.js applications on the edge with RHEL/Fedora
Containerizing your Node.js applications at the edge on RHEL/Fedora
Advanced container management at the edge for Node.js applications (this post)  

In the first part, we introduced you to the hardware and software for our Node.js-based edge example as well as some of the details on laying the foundation for deploying the application by building and installing the operating system using Fedora IoT.
In the second part we dug a bit deeper into the application itself, and how to build, bundle, deploy, and update the Node.js application using Podman and containers.

Through practical examples, we will learn how to create a Quarkus project, configure and consume SOAP services, and expose RESTful endpoints. Additionally, we will see how to manage JSON data serialization and deserialization using Camel Quarkus.
Quarkus project creation
For project configuration, it is required to create the application named code-with-quarkus-camel-soap, which will be using Quarkus 3.2 with Apache Camel version 4.0.


Review the compatibility matrix.
There are two options to carry out this configuration, detailed below.

In this series of articles, we&#x27;ll explore the road toward AI (Figure 1 ) and how your organization can smoothly transition toward incorporating AI into its platforms and applications. 
Clean architecture isn&#x27;t the only topic I cover, you know! So, welcome aboard as we steer our focus toward artificial intelligence and machine learning (for now, at least, as these principles will map on the domain of AI/ML as well).

years now, the kernel community has been stuck in a reactive posture with
regard to hardware vulnerabilities.  Each problem shows up with its own
scary name, and kernel developers find a way to mitigate it, usually losing
performance in the process.  Jackman said that it is time to take back the
initiative against these vulnerabilities by reconsidering the more
general use of address-space isolation.</span>

                              <span>Optimizing the kernel&#x27;s memory use is made much easier if developers have
an accurate idea of how memory is being used, but the kernel&#x27;s
instrumentation is not as good as it could be.  When Suren Baghdasaryan and
Kent Overstreet presented their
memory-allocation profiling work, which is meant to address this
shortcoming, at the 2023 Linux Storage, Filesystem, Memory Management, and
BPF Summit, their objective was uncontroversial but the proposed solution
ran into opposition that played out at length on the mailing lists (example)
over the last year.  So it may be a bit surprising that, when the two
returned to the memory-management track in the 2024 gathering, the
controversy was gone and the discussion focused on improving details of the
implementation.</span>

                              <span>The kernel stack is a scarce and tightly constrained resource; kernel
developers often have to go far out of their way to avoid using too much
stack space.  The size of the stack is also fixed, leading to situations
where it is too small for some code paths, while wastefully large for
others.  At the 2024 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit, Pasha Tatashin proposed
making the kernel stack size dynamic, making more space available when
needed while saving memory overall.  This change is not as easy to
implement as it might seem, though.</span>

structure is a complicated beast, but some parts of it are more
intimidating than others.  The mapcount field is one of the
scarier parts.  It allegedly records the number of references to the page
in page tables, but, as David Hildenbrand described during the
memory-management track at the 2024 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit, things are more
complicated than that.  Few people truly understand the semantics of this
field, but the situation will hopefully get better over time.</span>

       fallback behavior using markup. This allows developers to
       pull such declarations out of the JavaScript components and into the

       example shows how this works with the Suspense element, with a similar
       approach in vue.js.

                              <span>When building a server-side rendered web application, it&#x27;s valuable
       to test the HTML that&#x27;s generated through templates. While these can be
       tested through end-to-end tests running in the browser, such tests are
       slow and more work to maintain than unit tests. My colleague
       Matteo Vaccari has written an article on how to use TDD
       to test drive these templates using xunit-style tools which can be run
       easily from the command line or as part of build scripts.
In this first installment Matteo describes how such tests can check the
       generated HTML for validity, with examples in Java and Go.

                              <span>Initial support for native memory tracking (NMT) has recently been added as a feature to GraalVM Native Image. It is currently available in early access builds and will be available in the future GraalVM for JDK 23 release. The addition of NMT will allow users of Native Image to better understand how their applications are using off-heap memory. 
Background
The terminology “native memory” is sometimes used interchangeably with “off-heap memory” or “unmanaged memory.” When a Java application is run on the JVM, &quot;native memory&quot; refers to any memory not allocated on the Java heap. Since the the JVM is implemented in C++, this includes the memory that the JVM uses under the hood for its internal operations as well as memory requested with Unsafe#allocateMemory(long), or from external libraries.…</span>

                              <span>As software becomes increasingly integrated into our daily lives, the importance of secure coding and programming safety cannot be overstated. From online banking to healthcare records, sensitive information is being transmitted and stored in software systems, making them prime targets for cyber attacks. As a result, it&#x27;s crucial for developers to understand and implement best practices for secure coding to ensure the safety and privacy of user data. In this article, we explore the various techniques and strategies that can be used to make software more secure and resilient to attacks.
Programming safety
Programming safety is multidimensional and subjective. We consider four types of programming safety: memory safety, null safety, type safety, and thread safety.

the page allocator, which allocates memory in units of pages, and the slab
allocator, which allocates arbitrarily-sized chunks that are usually (but

stands behind commonly used kernel functions like kmalloc().  At

performance characteristics.  On such systems, poor placement can lead to
significantly worse performance.  A memory-management-track discussion at

                              <span>As the shiny new KDE Plasma 6 desktop makes its way into distribution
releases, a small group of developers is still trying to preserve the
KDE experience circa 2008. The Trinity Desktop Environment
(TDE), is a continuation of KDE 3 that has maintained the
old-school desktop with semi-regular releases since 2010. The most
recent release, R14.1.2,
was announced
on April 28. TDE does deliver a usable retro desktop, but with
some limitations that hamper its usability on modern systems.</span>

	Bundles are multiple buffers used in a single operation. On the
	receive side, this means a single receive may utilize multiple
	buffers, reducing the roundtrip through the networking stack from N
	per N buffers to just a single one. On the send side, this also
	enables better handling of how an application deals with sends from
	a socket, eliminating the need to serialize sends on a single
	socket. Bundles work with provided buffers, hence this feature also
	adds support for provided buffers for send operations.</span>

Software evolution and compatibility
Linux distributions are a living thing. During their lifetime, they are born at release, receive updates, and eventually &quot;die&quot; when support ends. They spawn descendant distributions. They sometimes even fight! The whole point of the distribution is to make an interdependent, cohesive whole, so there are many shared components. When those shared components are changed within a distribution, the question of compatibility is imminent.
Application binary interface (ABI) compatibility is a specific type of dependency: between separately compiled binaries and …</span>

The traditional view of hypervisor storage

                              <span>Non-uniform memory access (NUMA) systems are organized with their CPUs
grouped into nodes, each of which has memory attached to it.  All memory in
the system is accessible from all CPUs, but memory attached to the local
node is faster.  The kernel&#x27;s memory-policy
(&quot;mempolicy&quot;) interface allows threads to inform the kernel about how
they would like their memory placed to get the best performance.  In recent
years, the NUMA concept has been extended to support the management of
different types of memory in a system, pushing the limits of the mempolicy
subsystem.  In a remotely presented session at the 2024 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit, Gregory Price discussed
the ways in which the kernel&#x27;s memory-policy support should evolve to
handle today&#x27;s more-complex systems.</span>

Your kids are going on vacation with their grandparents; you want to increase their cell phone plan with more bandwidth and gigabytes so you can see them enjoy the beach through a video call with your parents.
You’re on a business trip and you&#x27;re relying on your company’s telco provider for roaming.

But you can’t do either of those things, because there’s an issue with the mobile application provider. Enter Red Hat Technical Account Management to assist in this situation. 
Diagnosing the problem
Let’s add a little more context. A telecommunications service provider (telco) provides a mobile application whose front end targets Red Hat&#x27;s single-sign on (SSO) tool to authenticate and authorize users to either pay plans or enlarge plans.

                              <span>Working on the Linux kernel has always been unlike working on
many other software projects.
One particularly noticeable difference is the decentralized nature of the
kernel&#x27;s testing infrastructure. Projects such as

syzkaller, KernelCI,
or the kernel self tests
test the kernel in different ways. On February 28, Helen
Koike

posted a patch set that would add continuous integration (CI) scripts for
the whole kernel. The response was generally positive, but several people
suggested changes.</span>

                              <span>Ronnie Sahlberg, Jonathan Maple, and Jeremy Allison of CiQ have published
a white
paper looking at the security-relevant bug fixes applied (or not
applied) to the RHEL 8.x kernel over time.


	This means that over time, the security of the RHEL kernels get
	worse and worse as more issues are discovered in the upstream code
	and are potentially exploitable but fewer and fewer of the fixes
	for these known bugs are back-ported into RHEL kernels.

	After reaching RHEL 8.7, the theory is that the kernel has been
	stabilized, with a corresponding improvement in security. However
	we still have an influx of newly discovered bugs in the upstream
	kernel affecting RHEL 8.7 that are not addressed. Each minor
	version of upstream is released on an approximately quarterly basis
	and we can see that the influx of new bugs that are unaddressed in
	RHEL is growing. The number of known issues in these kernels
	increases by approximately 250 new bugs per quarter or more.</span>

Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization is Red Hat&#x27;s solution for companies trending toward modernization by adopting a containerized architecture for their applications, but find virtualization remains a necessary part of their data center deployment strategy.
Frankly, some applications are still simply unable to be containerized, and that&#x27;s okay. OpenShift Virtualization addresses this by providing a more modern paradigm that cohesively manages the need for containers and virtual machines in a unified platform.
One concern we at Red Hat must address is this: in addition to providing feature parity, how do we maintain a customer experience that is similar to that of the products and configurations that the customer is used to so that …</span>

                              <span>Butane (formerly the Fedora CoreOS Config Transpiler, or FCCT) is a command-line utility that is used to generate human readable configuration into Ignition configuration files. Butane is an open source repo maintained by CoreOS, and contributed to and enhanced by many. If you take a look at the Butane repo and look in the Config folder, you can almost see some of the stakeholders. These are configurations which are used to target different platforms (i.e., FCOS, Flatcar Container Linux, Red Hat OpenShift, etc.) Each of these configurations will have a stable and experimental phase that also targets stable and experimental specs of Ignition. I would describe these as levers that a contributor can exercise to impact the functionality they want to expose to the end users of these target plat…</span>

The inspect file is a very useful tool for troubleshooting applications and systems deployed in RHOCP 4 and can be extremely useful in a series of situations.
It also avoids the unnecessarily separated collection of data (Pod Logs, route YAML, BuildConfig YAMLs) given it brings everything that is namespace bounded—except custom resources—directly to one goal. 
This article covers what the inspect file is, how to collect it, how to use it for troubleshooting, and how it compares to the must-gather file (spoiler: it is not the same thing). This will help clarify why we usually ask for this file during the t…</span>

at a a
recent report on the Ebury root kit, with a focus on the 2011 compromise of kernel.org, which may have
been more extensive than believed at the time.


	In 2014, ESET researchers said the 2011 attack likely infected
	kernel.org servers with a second piece of malware they called
	Ebury. The malware, the firm said, came in the form of a malicious
	code library that, when installed, created a backdoor in OpenSSH
	that provided the attackers with a remote root shell on infected
	hosts with no valid password required. In a little less than 22
	months, starting in August 2011, Ebury spread to 25,000
	servers. Besides the four belonging to the Linux Kernel
	Organization, the infection also touched one or more servers inside
	hosting facilities and an unnamed domain registrar and web hosting
	provider.</span>

describe groups of pages has been one of the most fundamental
transformations within the kernel in recent years.  Since the folio
transition affects many subsystems, it is fitting that the subject was
covered at the beginning of the 2024 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit in a joint session of the
storage, filesystem, and memory-management tracks.  Matthew Wilcox used the
session to review the work that has been done in this area and to discuss

of the Arch-based Manjaro distribution is now available with
the 6.9 kernel, GNOME 46, Xfce 4.18, and an update to the
Pamac package
installer. This is also the project&#x27;s first release with KDE Plasma 6:
The Plasma edition comes with the latest Plasma 6.0 series and KDE
Gear 24.02. It brings exciting new improvements to your desktop.
With Plasma 6, KDE&#x27;s technology stack has undergone major upgrades:
a transition to the latest version of application framework, Qt, and
an improved graphics platform when Wayland is used. These changes are
as smooth and unnoticeable to the users as possible. You will see the
same familiar desktop environment that you know and love. But these
under-the-hood upgrades benefit Plasma&#x27;s security, efficiency, and
performance, and improve support for modern hardware. Thus Plasma
delivers an overall more reliable user experience, while paving the
way for many more improvements in the future.
The project also offers minimal install images with the 6.6 LTS
and 6.1 LTS kernels to support older hardware.</span>

                              <span>Large language models (LLMs) have been the subject of much discussion and
scrutiny recently. Of particular interest to open-source enthusiasts are the
problems with running LLMs on one&#x27;s own hardware — especially when doing so
requires NVIDIA&#x27;s proprietary CUDA toolkit, which remains unavailable in many
environments.
Mozilla has developed
llamafile as a
potential solution to these problems. Llamafile can compile LLM weights
into portable, native executables for easy integration, archival, or
distribution. These executables can take advantage of supported GPUs when
present, but do not require them.</span>

                              <span>You can use the policy framework in Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes (RHACM) to define and manage configurations of resources across a fleet of clusters. When packaged with the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM), Kubernetes-native applications become resources that you can manage, similar to the built-in resource types on a cluster. In the 2.10 release of RHACM, we are introducing a new kind of policy template, OperatorPolicy, as a tech preview feature which helps manage these specific types more completely and more easily.
In this article, you’ll learn the basics of the OperatorPolicy, and you’ll see a demo about how to use it. Because this is a tech preview feature, we are looking forward to hearing your feedback about how we can improve these features for you.

on May 12 after a typical nine-week development cycle.  Once again,
this is a major release containing a lot of changes and new features.  Our
merge-window summaries (part 1, part 2) covered those changes; now that
the development cycle is complete, the time has come to look at where all
that work came from — and to introduce a new and experimental LWN feature
for readers interested in this kind of information.</span>

                              <span>Maintainers of open-source projects sometimes have disagreements with
contributors over how contributions are reviewed, modified, merged, and
credited. A written policy describing how contributions are handled can
help maintainers set reasonable expectations for potential contributors.
In turn, that can make the maintainer&#x27;s job easier because it can help
reduce a source of friction in the project.  A guide to help create this
kind of policy for a project has recently been developed.</span>

                              <span>Linus has released the 6.9 kernel. 
&quot;So 6.9 is now out, and last week has looked quite stable (and the
whole release has felt pretty normal).&quot;
Significant changes in this release include
the ability to create pidfds for individual
threads,
the BPF arena subsystem,
the BPF token security mechanism,
truncate() support in io_uring,
support for the Rust language on 64-bit Arm systems,
weighted interleaving in the
memory-management subsystem,
the device-mapper
virtual data optimizer target,
initial FUSE passthrough support,
and more.

                              <span>The extensible scheduler class (or &quot;sched_ext&quot;) is a comprehensive

This is a beta preview of Python 3.13
Python 3.13 is still in development. This release, 3.13.0b1, is the first of four beta release previews of 3.13.
Beta release previews are intended to give the wider community the 
opportunity to test new features and bug fixes and to prepare their 
projects to support the new feature release.
We strongly encourage maintainers of third-party Python projects to test with 3.13 during the beta phase and report issues found to the Python bug tracker

                              <span>The so-called software supply chain starts with source code. But most security measures and tooling
don&#x27;t kick in until source is turned into an artifact—a source
tarball, binary build, container image, or other method of delivering a
release to users. The gittuf project
is an attempt to provide a security layer for Git that can handle key management,
enforce security policies for repositories, and guard against attacks
at the version-control layer. At Open Source Summit North America (OSSNA), Aditya Sirish A
Yelgundhalli and Billy Lynch presented
an introduction to gittuf with an overview of its goals and
status.</span>

that the Fedora Asahi
Remix for Apple Arm hardware, based on Fedora
40, is now available:
KDE Plasma 6 as our flagship desktop
experience. It also features a custom Calamares-based initial setup
wizard. A GNOME variant is also available, featuring GNOME 46, with
both desktop variants matching what Fedora Linux offers. Fedora Asahi
Remix also provides a Fedora Server variant for server workloads and
other types of headless deployments. Finally, we offer a Minimal image
for users that wish to build their own experience from the ground up.

                              <span>청소년 정신건강과 스마트폰, 소셜미디어의 관계는 최근 들어 자주 논의되는 주제입니다. 청소년기가 스마트폰과 소셜미디어를 빼놓고 얘기할 수 없는 세상이 된 뒤로 청소년들의 정신건강이 ‘위기’라고 불러야 할 만큼 나빠졌다는 주장을 해온 대표적인 학자가 조너선 하이트입니다. 반대로 정신건강이 어느 정도 나빠졌을 수 있지만, 이를 위기라고 단정 짓기엔 아직 일러 보이며, 그 원인이 스마트폰과 소셜미디어에만 있는지도 신중하게 살펴야 한다고 주장하는 학자들도 있습니다. 뉴욕타임스 데이비드 월러스웰스가 양측의 의견을 두루 살핀 칼럼을 번역하고 해설을 썼습니다. 전문 번역: → 더 보기</span>

Then, we walked through control plane deployment and data plane configuration. 
We’re now ready to add OpenStack compute nodes to the control plane to run virtual machines. The deployment, unsurprisingly, relies on another YAML file. 
When released, you can either join an already deployed Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9.4 node or pilot bare metal deployment from scratch. For the scope of this article, we are going with the first option. The RHEL compute server has two network cards (eth0 and eth1).

Let’s begin with the OpenStack Operator.
The OpenStack Operator
The OpenStack Operator consists of three parts (a CatalogSource, an OperatorGroup, and a Subscription), each defining a different resource for managing Operators within an OpenShift/Kubernetes cluster using the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM). The resources aim to set up an Operator for OpenStack, likely for managing OpenStack services within the cluster, are as foll…</span>

But the 
conversation about the proposal did surface some areas where the
distribution could 
perhaps be more inclusive with regard to the other desktop choices
available.  The project believes that it
benefits from being opinionated and not requiring users to make
multiple decisions before they can even install the distribution, but there

                              <span>While large language models (LLMs) offer incredible potential, they also come with their share of challenges. Working with LLMs demands high-quality training data, specialized skills and knowledge, and extensive computing resources. The process of forking and retraining a model is also time consuming and expensive.
The InstructLab project offers an open source approach to generative AI, sourcing community contributions to support regular builds of an enhanced version of an LLM. This approach is designed to lower costs, remove barriers to testing and experimentation, and improve alignment—that is, ensuring the model&#x27;s answers are accurate, unbiased, and consistent with the values and goals of its users and creators.

Kai integrates large language models (LLMs) with static code analysis to facilitate code modifications within a developer&#x27;s IDE, helping transition to other modern programming languages and frameworks efficiently. 
Using a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach, Kai enhances LLM outputs with historical code changes and analysis data, ensuring context-specific guidance. This method is model agnostic and does not require model fine-tuning, making Kai a versatile tool for large-scale modernization projects, demonstrated by updating a Java EE application to Quarkus using a Visual Studio Code (VS Code) plug-in.

We believe our best work is done when we work together to find new solutions. So we asked, what if an operating system could be updated via image-based transactions, and what if those images could be built and shipped like a container? What if we could use the same tools, skills, and patterns as today’s containerized applications, closing the gaps between pipeline and production? The result is a way to think differently about how to build, deploy, and manage Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).

Each one operates independently and requires a completely different set of tools for building, managing, and configuring.
But no more! Image mode for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) allows you to build and manage a full operating system just like a container image.
What are bootable containers?
Application container base images are Open Container Initiative (OCI) container images that are usually trimmed down as far as possible, to exclude the OS kernel, hardware support, and anything else that application containers do not need when running inside of a host OS.
Bootable containers use this same OCI image format, but contain the …</span>

curl up is never a big meeting/conference but we have in the past
sometimes been around twenty-five attendees. This year&#x27;s amount of
fifteen was the smallest so far, but in this small set of people we
have a set of long-term well-known curl contributors. It is not a
big list of attendees that creates a good curl up.</span>
